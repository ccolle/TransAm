After breakfast (the bad oatmeal again, although better when augmented with pecan nuts) I said goodbye to to Stephen and set course to Yorktown.
I now veered off the "potomac heritage route".
The heat of yesterday had dissappeared and it now was a lovely 23Â°C, with a welcome tailwind.
The by now familiar wheat fields formed the landscape the first part of the day.
Later I got on to the us-17 highway which was quite scary when the shoulder dissappeared completely for substantial distances.

The bridges over the Rappahannock and York rivers were ver impressive. Really high with an awesome view.
Thanks to the tailwind I arrived in Yorktown (the starting point of the Transamerica trail) just before 12.
I had a veggie-delight in a subway (first time ever!) and cycled a couple of miles further to the Newsport News park campsite.

A quick but hazardous (busy busy roads) trip to the food lion (again!) ensured I had food for the evening and the next day.
My throat was feeling a bit sore and i felt cold. Putting on my thermal underwear made me feel much better and not much later I went for an early sleep.
