I set my alarm for 5 AM and was on the road by 6 AM. The reason for this early start was that the forecasts predicted up to 39Â° Celcius in the afternoon.
The roads here are straight and seem to go on endlessly through the prairies.
When I was 30 miles out of Eureka Robyn called me to tell me I forgot my shorts and said she would bring them to me herself.
After a pitstop in Cassoday I got on the final straight "stretch" of 60km towards Newton.
As in the previous days I crossed a number of TransAm racers.

Just before 12 AM I already rode into Newton, succeeding in escaping the insane heat that was about to strike.
As I was waiting in front of Newton's bicycle shop, Jake walked up!
I had finally caught up with him.
He was taking a rest day in Newton.
I contacted my warmshowers host, Janet.
She told me I was welcome in an hour so I had lunch with Jake in the subway (his idea!).
In the subway we met John, one of Janet's sons.

After lunch I went to Janet, took a shower and asked if Jake could stay for the night as well (no problem).
Then Robyn called me to say she arrived in Newton with my shorts.
I quickly cycled to her location.
She handed me my shorts, a slice of homemade zucchini cake and a homegrown cucumber.
Robyn followed me back to the bike shop. I dropped off my bicycle for the spoke replacement and Robyn was very eager to meet the shop's owners.
I guess she has heard a lot of them from passing cyclists.
The rest of the afternoon was spent relaxing at Janet's house.
Jake arrived in the late afternoon.
Janet prepared a delicious dinner and an exquisite dessert: mulberry and rubarb pie with icecream. Delicious!
Not long thereafter we turned in for the night.
