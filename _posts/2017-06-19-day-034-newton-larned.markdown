I had set my alarm for 5:30 because there was a long day ahead of me.
I quickly ate breakfast and said goodbye to Janet and Orvin and thanked them for their very generous hospitality.
At 6:30 I was on the road.
The sky was clouded and overcast, a nice cool 18Â°C and little or no wind.
Ideal riding conditions.
I took a quick stop in Beuhler and a longer break at 80km in Nickerson where I encountered another TransAm racer. He was taking it easy and "only" doing 150 miles a day.

Approaching midday the sun broke through and the strong south cross wind picked up again.
A small pink dot in the distance appeared to be Amanda when I got closer.
She was heading for Larned as well.

In Larned I went to a gasstation for rehydratation with powerade and when I exited the shop I saw a subway across the street.
In the subway I was pondering to do another 50 km as it was not 3 PM yet.
When I stood up it was clear my legs did not agree and off to the city park it was, passing the police station along the way to get permission.

At the city park I went to the showers of the public pool and set up my tent.
I was feeling very tired and was glad I did not decide to continue.

In the evening another cyclist rolled up.
Noah from Tenessee, also a westbounder like me.
He is travelling ultra light and I first misstook him for a TransAm racer.
Exhausted I went to sleep at 21:00.
