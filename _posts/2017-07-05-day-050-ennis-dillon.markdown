Last night Liz and I agreed to be at the grocery store at 5:45 AM to observe Mike's exact arrival time.
While Mike was packing, we packed faster and went off to the store.
Mike arrived at 5:56.
I showed my piece of paper with my 6:04 prediction on it.
Liz had predicted 5:58, winning her the bet and I now owed her an icecream.

We ate breakfast at the grocery store and Dave rolled up a little later.
Together we set course for Dillon. I had arranged a warmshower stay there.
The day started with a long climb out of the valley.
Looking back I could see the whole valley and the city of Ennis shrouded in the morning mist.
On the descent I zoomed through western-looking Sheridan.
The legs were turning well and I progress was fast.

I had a snack and a drink in the gasstation of Twin Bridges and then turned southwest towards Dillon.
On the way there I met a couple from Wales who are on their last leg of cycling around the world.
I already arrived at Dillon around 12 and when I rolled into town I saw, with great joy, a large sign with a green background and the white and yellow letters.
That's right, a subway!
After a nice veggie delight I went to the library and updated my journal.

A couple of hours later Mike,Liz and Dave arrived and we met in front of the Safeway.
We bought groceries for the next day's breakfast and I treated Liz on a pint of Ben and Jerry's and was relieved of my debt.
Next we went to Tammie and Mark's plac (the warmshower hosts).
They welcomed us warmly and offered a shower and laundry.
I cooked an instant Knorr rice meal.
Either instant meals are better than I remembered or my foodstandarts have gone way down on this trip because it tasted absolutely delicious.
Tammie proposed to sleep indoors. Dave and I gladly accepted whil Mike and Liz preferred pitching their tent in the front garden.
