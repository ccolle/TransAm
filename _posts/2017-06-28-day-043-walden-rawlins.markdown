When I was eating breakfast next to my tent Chris walked up and asked if I'd like some french toast.
Or course I did and I joined the aca gang again for breakfast (Jake was still sleeping).
When I was ready to get on the road I said goodbye to the tour group and thanked Chris again.

In the morning I passed Jim and Denise from Iowa, cycling a new route called the Eastern Express.
At the state border of Wyoming we took each others picture in front of the sign.

The route followed the wide and open valley north towards Saratoga where I had lunch with a brownie sundae as dessert.
I hesitated to stay in Saratoga as Jake, Noah, Jim, Denise and the aca group would spend the night there but it was only 1 PM and I decided to push for Rawlins.

On the part north towards Walcott I had a strong cross wind with a slight tailwind component so I was speeding along.
At Walcott the route turned west towards Rawlins, straight into the strong wind.
There, the route put me on an interstate for 20 km which was uncomfortable as cars and trucks were passing me at 75 miles per hour.
The exit at Sinclair couldn't come to soon and when I finally got there (it took a while in the heavy headwind) I went to the gas station and ordered French toast.
For the last part of the day the route took me through the industrial district of Sinclair and as I pushed into Rawlins insanely strong gusts of wind were trying to push me off the road.
I was swerving all over the shoulder whil the sky became brown, filled with dust.

I went to the Walmart, bought groceries and cycled then to the KOA campgrounds of Rawlins.
The lady at the desk let me inspect and pick out the tent site with the most wind cover (they had wooden panels to protect campers from the winds).

Later I met Felix from Arizona there who has travelled all over the US (by car).
He said several trucks had been blown over due to the strong winds.
He also asked if I like fruit and when I said yes proceeded me to hand me precut pineapple in ziplock bags, dried figs, a papaya, a mango and a banana to top it off.
He asked about me route the next day. Felix was planning to drive on the same road and promised to honk and wave when he passed me.
