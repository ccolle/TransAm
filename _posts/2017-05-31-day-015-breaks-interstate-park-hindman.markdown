On my way out of the park I took the time to walk to a viewpont over the canyon.
The day started with a descent towards Elkhorn, during which I passed the Dutch couple (Meta & Gerrit) and an American woman (Cathy) who is also cycling the TransAm.
Cycling through the canyon and the rock formations was a beautiful start of the day.
Soon I crossed the state border into Kentucky.
I had been told that Kentucky has a lot of dogs.
Already after my first day I can confirm this.
There are dogs everywhere, who desire, above all else, barking at and chasing after cyclists.
Luckily most of them are behind a fence or on a leash.
Sadly not all of them.
The day had more than enough steep climbs in store.
I ate lunch in a small restaurant at the side of the road, an egg-cheese sandwhich with small fries.
I talked with two guys who were installing a new gas pipeline closeby.
Next I went to the dollar general (cheap supermarket) nextdoor for icecream.
Then it was back on the road again in the hot and sunny afternoon.

I arrived at "Knott historical society cyclist hosted hostel" in Hindman and was greeted by David Smith.
David is just a little crazy.
In the first five minutes he was telling me to look at his cat's balls and how huge they were.
I was offered the choice between the free (only camping spot) and the deluxe (dinner, breakfast, beer, shower,...) option.
I went for the latter.

Scott arrived later followed by Meta and Gerrit.
David wanted to take us to a nearby mexican restaurant for dinner (on our own cost ...).
We waited untill Cathy arrived (she had called ahead).
The dutch couple declined and stayed and the campsite to cook their own meal.
When we returned from the restaurant David made us an enormous icecream.
No one was able to finish it.
