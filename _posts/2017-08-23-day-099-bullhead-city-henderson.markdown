I got up early to get going before the heat set in.
I crossed the Colorado river back into Nevada and started a long and steep climb out of Laughlin.
In Palm Gardens I took a break at a gas station and for the first time I wasn't allowed to refill my water bottles with water from the soda fountain but had to refill them at the sink of the restroom.
The somewhat grumpy lady said to watch out for the heat while riding through the Nevada desert.
From Palm Springs it was another 35 km uphill stretch to Searchlight where I took a brake at the gas station.
They only had a McDonalds there and for the first and last time on my trip I went in and asked for something without meat.
After a strange look they recommended a sausage mcmuffin without the sausage, which I ordered with a mango smoothie.

From Searchlight it was 70 more km through the hot barren desert to Henderson where Rick Nielson, a warmshowers host, had accepted my request to stay the night.
Along the US-95 I noticed what seemed like a strange blue lake off in the distance but as I got closer I realized it was a huge solar power plant.
When I closing in on the intersection of 95 and 93 my flat tire had slowly ran flat.
I did not want to replace the tube in the burning sun so I quickly reinflated it and continued cycling.
I repeated this a few times but eventually on the way into Henderson I ran a pinch flat.
Dark clouds were rolling in and I could see numerous lightning strikes not too far away so I did a rush tube replacement and quickly cycled onward to the nearby subway to take shelter.
When I was inside for a few minutes the wind picked up and rain started pouring down.
According to the locals it had been quite a while since they had a storm this bad and many streets flooded.

After waiting out the storm at the subway I cycled to Rick's place which appeared to be really close.
At the front door I noticed a large sign with Belgium written on it.
I later learned that his daughter studies in Ghent and he and his wife, Andrea, have been to Belgium.
In the evening we went to see Hoover Dam together and have a burger in Rick's favourite burger place.
