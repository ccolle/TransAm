After a rough night's sleep I packed up and had breakfast as the sun started lighting the mountain peaks on the west side of the valley.
Early in the morning it was still cool and I had a nice start of the day.
Later on the climbs felt hard and I was struggling.
I also snapped spoke #12, that makes half of all the spokes in my rear wheel.
In Austin I had second breakfast, pancakes with eggs and a delicious blueberry milkshake.
It was so dense I had to eat it with a spoon.
It was practically a large cup of blueberry icecream.

After that much needed recharge I took it really easy and slowly pedalled up the hills out of Austin.
I started the 110 km stretch without any services to Eureka.
The heat picked up and riding became harder.
Luckily there was a nice breeze, cross and headwind at first but as I turned north east I had it in the back.
During the afternoon I heard loud bangs.
I assume they were sonic booms of jets but I didn't see any.

Later I crossed a westbounder (I was heading east) and we exchanged some tips on the road ahead.
He was wearing long sleeves, a large sunhat and had his face wrapped up in a scarf.
There I was in my short sleeve cycling jersey.
The last 20 km into Eureka were tough, the wind was from all directions, mainly heavy crosswinds.
I was feeling tired and was counting down every km, every 100m, ...
On the way into Eureka I bought groceries and went to the "grillhouse" bar.
I settled for theonly vegeterian option of a baked patato with a salad.
Luckily there was a brownie icecream dessert which I obviously ordered.

After dinner I went to the city part to set up camp and had some trouble finding it.
When I was reading in my tent later that night I suddenly heard a noise and 2 other guys were setting up camp right next to me in the dark.
I felt a bit uncomfortable as I didn't see them arrive and didn't know why they were camping at the city park.
It was already after 10 PM but they obviously did not do any effort to be quiet.
