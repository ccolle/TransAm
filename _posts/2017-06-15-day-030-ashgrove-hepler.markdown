I was feeling somewhat better when I got up but still felt sleepy.
We waited untill the heavy thunderstorms that had started around 4 AM to pass over and at 8:30 I was on the road.
In the morning the dark clouds kept the sun at bay and the strong south wind made a nice cool morning ride.

The sun quickly broke through and temperatures started rising.
Around midday I passed men's #3 of the race, Bo Dudley, and not long thereafter Jose Bermudez in #4, he was sitting at the side of the road and when I stopped to ask if everything was ok he said (looking very tired) he was just feeling a little sleepy.
Furthermore I passed three (normal) eastbounders, one of which was Rik from Limburg, Belgium.
He is the first cyclist I've seen so far that isn't wearing a helmet...

I crossed into Kansas and ate lunch in Pittsburg (yes in a subway of course) already with a 100 km on the counter.
I called ahead to a church 50km ahead to hear if they could host me. The answer was yes.
I bought food for dinner and breakfast of the next day in the Walmart.

During the afternoon I passed more TransAm racers.
At 17:30 I arrived at the Immanuel Lutheran Church.
The AC was going strong and there is a piano!
I've been secretly hoping to find a piano everytime I stayed indoors.
I prepared my (instant) meal in the large kitchen and went outside to cheer on another TransAm racer I saw approaching on the live-tracking map.

In the evening the pastor passed by to say hi and gave me the green light to use and eat anything in the kitchen.
Vigorous icecream eating ensued.
At night heavy thunderstorms rolled in and the lightnings were continually lighting up the whole sky.
I was very glad I was sleeping indoors.
