I had a late start in the hope to see Patrick in the morning but as 8 AM approached I got on the road.
It was a Saturday and on the way out of Folsom I saw many cyclists.
Two women, Andrea and Ellen passed me and we started talking.
Together we rode to Winter, a very pleasant town that is a very popular stop for cyclists.
Andrea and Ellen treated me on a smoothie and a ginger-oats cockie.
We continued to Davis together and rode through the big university campus there.
On the way out of Davis I ran a flat and on closer inspection it appeared that my back tire was totally worn out and had a large tear in it.
Ellen patched it up with some gum, tape and a dollar bill and we rode carefully back to a bicycle store in Davis.
On the way back I also snapped spoke #11.
In the bicycle store Andrea and Ellen were so kind to pay for my new tire and the spoke repair.
After they stuffed my pockets with Cliff bars I continued towards Sacramento while Ellen and Andrea returned to Vacaville.
I had a very nice ride with them and it was very nice meeting these very generous cyclists.

In Sacramento I had lunch in a subway (veggie pattie yes!) and from thereon I followed a cycle path along the American River, for 50km ,all the way to Folsom.
There were a lot of cyclists and runners on the trail and a lot of waterfun in the American river.
I arrived in Folsom and looked for my wamshowers stay for the night.
Tony was out in the front yard and greeted me while I was looking at my map on the street corner.
He showed me in and met his wife, Cecilia and 3 of their 4 sons.
I took a very refreshing dip in their pool and after that we talked for a while and watched a baseball game.
For dinner Cecilia had made burgers with delicious pumpkin fries.
In the evening the tabletennis table was rolled out and I played some games with the boys.
