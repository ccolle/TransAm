I emptied my jar of peanut butter and the jar of strawberry jam at breakfast.
A strong headwind greeted me as soon as I rolled out of the campsite.
The road bounced over the hills with short and steep ascents.
As I approached Troutville the overcast sky cleared up.

My second veggie-delight ever was eaten in the subway of Daleville.
I ordered it significantly smoother than the first time.

The scenic road between Daleville and Christiansburg runs through the lush and green valley of Catawba.
The hot afternoon ride through the valley was amazing, the views on the surrounding hills were well worth conquering the steep climbs.
I passed a box containing free water for passing cyclist. A welcome gift on this long and lonely road.
All of a sudden I saw two cyclists appearing in front of me.
I wondered if they were the cyclists I was told about yesterday.
When I caught up to Jake and Jonathan it turned out they were.
There are doing the TransAm as well, making some detours to visit family and friends.

Jake (or Jonathan, I don't remember...) rode a bike that he had built himself with an eleven speed internal gear.
When I told the other guy he was pedalling asymmetrically he gave me a weird explanation about his crank being longer on one side, and to compensate for this he had shifted his handlebars to the left.
We continued together to Christiansville.
When we arrived J&J wanted to search for a place where they could sleep/camp for free.
With an additional 40 miles on the counter and rather tired I was in need of comfort.
I decided to go to a motel in the center of Christiansburg and said goodbye to J&J.
After a shower and a quick lay-down I went to a mexican restaurant across the street.
They have delicious vegetarian fajitas.
