We woke up early in the morning to cycle up Logan pass before the road closed.
We left our gear at the campgrounds and a litlle after 6 we were on the road.
The day started with a gradual climb along the river through the misty forest.
The incline increased and as I gained in altitude I had amazing views over the wild mountains.
The "going to the sun road" is very cool to cycle up and is possible the most scenic road I have driven so far.
It carves its way through the mountainside with steep drops on the outside of the road.

I arrived at Logan pass in a little over 2 hours later and did the hike out to "hidden lake".
There was still a lot of snow on the fantastic trail.
On the epic descent back down the bicycle-car roles were reversed and the cars were holding me up and I passed multiple.
When I arrived back at the campgrounds and packed my gear it was just after 11 and had to take the shuttle bus to Apgar at the south end of lake McDonald.
From there I cycled to Columbia Falls where I went to the subway again for lunch.
Mike and Dave joined me there later and I had my first "blizzard" in the DQ (Dairy Queen) across the street.

Mike fixed us a warmshowers stay in Whitefish and a short ride later we were greeted by Rita and Chuck and set up our tents in their garden.
After a nice shower we headed to downtown Whitefish and had a pizza.
We did some groceries for the next day and returned, very tired, to our tents.
