It was a cold and misty morning when we got up at 5:30.
We rode north through dense pine forests and then turned west to Hebgen lake and the appropriately named Earthquake lake.
It was created in 1959 after a severe earthquake.
Around 11 AM I pulled over at a closed saloon (it was the 4th of July) and met an eastbounder and his wife in the support car while I was eating a snack on the front porch.
They were very friendly and were interested in my cycling adventures.

Most of the day was downhill and I arrived at Ennis around 12.
Mike had already arrived and showed me the cyclists-only camping behind the local brewery.
I checked my rear shifter cable again to make sure it was holding up and cleaned the drivetrain.
Liz arrived later, followed by Dave who had punctured a tire along the way.

The heat was increasing (over 30 degrees Celcius) and in the afternoon we relaxed at the camping spot.
I made the mistake of shopping while being very hungry and bought too much food.
I had a late reverse-order lunch, starting with B&J icecream, followed by a salad and to finish some chips.

An eastbounder from Schotland arrived later and we all went to the brewery for whiskey tasting (I don't like whiskey so did not participate).
Afterwards they all went to a bar to have dinner.
I did not join them as I had bought lots of food that needed eating.

While I was sitting at the campspot Noah rolled up! He was very hungry and quickly went to a Mexican restaurant.
Not much later another cyclist showed up, Dan from New York.
There were now 7 cyclists spending the night there.
When we were getting ready to retreat back into our tents Mike announced he would be at the grocery store by 6 AM the next day.
Mike is a notorious slow starterand Liz and I madea beton what time he would actually show up at the grocery store.
We wrote our predictions on a piece of paper.
Under the loud bangs of fireworks off in the distance we turned in for the night.
