The sound of rain pouring down awoke me in the morning.
It had been raining all night and looking at the forecasts it would last until midday.
I decided to pack up in the heavy rain and wait it out under the roof behind the campstore.
Around 10 AM the rain lessened somewhat in intensity and I set off.

After a few miles I had to take a small ferry across the Green river.
A couple of hours later the rain finally stopped.
Cycling felt hard and tiring and my knee started to hurt again.
I planned for a lunch break in Sonora. I looked it up and knew of the subway there!
After a long lunchbreak (veggie delight of course) I set course to McDaniels.
During the afternoon, through the hilly countryside, I passes three Amish horse carriages.
Compared to my usual routine I arrived late at the campsite just west of McDaniels.
It was already close to 7 PM.
 I quickly unpacked everything and spread it out so my gear could dry.
 Next I hurried to the nearby restaurant, "Little Dave's".
 
 In an (for me) unusual surge of sociability I asked a couple of ladies who were exiting the restaurant about the quality of the pizza's.
 The conversation evolved to the topic of my trip. They wished me a nice and safe trip.
 
 The waitress of Little Dave's was very friendly and told me she had been in Belgium.
 I ordered a bean soup and a spaghetti marinara.
 When I was getting ready to pay the bill and leave a woman came up to me and asked if I had a place to stay for that night and offered to let me stay at their place.
 I thanked Cheryl for her kindness but said I already was installed at the campgrounds.
 She proceeded to take my bill and said she would cover it.
 When I stood outside I remembered that I wanted to take a rest day tomorrow as today had been hard.
 I went back inside and told Cheryl about the rest day.
 I was happy to hear that I was welcome to stay the next night.
 We exchanged numbers and I cycled back to the campsite.
 The sun was setting over the trees at the other side of the lake and the sky was pink and orange, reflected by the water.
 
 At night a violent thunderstorm swept it and the strong wind pulled the stakes out of the ground.
 Rain started pouring in as the rainfly was flapping wildly.
 I quickly went outside (in my underwear) and secured the stakes with heavy stones.
 Luckily the violent storm did not last very long.
