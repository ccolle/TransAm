As I was eating breakfast the park attendant rolled up and told me that I overpaid by 6$.
He said most cyclists don't read the sign properly and overpay.
On the way out I checked the sign carefully and concluded that it does not mention anything about the bicyclist fee being 11$ instead of 17$.

In the morning I raced towards Fallon thanks to a strong tailwind and a flat terrain.
I covered 80 km in only 3 hours and arrived there at 10:00.
I had a veggie patty sub in the subway there and refilled my water bottles.
From there it was 80 km to the next place with nothing but Nevada desert in between.
I followed the US-50, dubbed America's loneliest road, through the deserted and barren but scenic desert to Middlegate station.
When I arrived there I was running low on water and in dire need of a break.
When I walked up to the bar a terrifying, ear-deafening, noise roared across the sky.
I didn't know what was happening untill I saw the jet make a near pass above the bar.
I ordered a veggie burger and had a long lunch break.

Around 3 PM I was back on the road to do the 20 km to the next station, Cold Springs station.
After a short ride I relaxed in the bar, got into more comfortable clothes and later had dinner there.
I ordered the apple pie with icecream twice for desert.
At night strong winds picked up and shook my tent violently as thunderstorms flashed in the distance.
