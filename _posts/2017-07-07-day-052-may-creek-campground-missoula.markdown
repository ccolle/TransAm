We all would try to make it to Missoula today, a 170km away.
Lize and Mike were already on the road by 5:15, just as I was starting to pack up.
I left before Dave and Noah and was on the road by 6:15.
I had around 13 km to climb to chief jozef pass.
Under the morning clouds colored golden by the rising sun I saw a lot of deer as I made my way up the pass.
On the other side of the pass I had a sweet descent all the way to Sula.
It was still early so there was virtually no traffic and the road was steep enough to really fly down the bitterroot valley while the curves where wide and gentle enough I didn't need to pull the brake levers once!
I Sula I saw two bicycles outside of a gasstation and inside I ran into Liz and Mike finishing breakfast.
We set off together, following the meandering bitterroot river down to Hamilton.

In Hamilton we went to the bakery "River rising" on recommendation of Liz and I had a delicious blueberry bread pudding with a blueberry banana smoothie.
While we were enjoying our tasty snacks Noah rolled up.
I was back on the road first and pedalled hard because I wanted to make it to the ACA headquarters before closing time.
It was another hot day and under the burning sun I arrived there around 3 PM, well before closing time.

At ACA HQ I received a tour of the office, free icecream and soda, and a 6 month subscription of the ACA magazine.
I kept the number of icecream snacks down to 4.
Liz, Mike, Dave and Noah showed up a good hour later.
We weighed our loaded bikes.
I guessed mine to be 64 pounds.
The scale showed 63, only one pound off!
After that we all went our seperate ways to the places we would stay that night.

I had a warmshowers in Missoula where I planned to take a restday the next day.
When I arrived there I was greeted by Tami and Kirk who had been there for two weeks waiting on a spare Schlumpf drive for their recumbant tandem bicycle.
The showed me around the house and introduced me to the host Bruce.
He has a concert piano there, awesome!

Later I went to the grocery store and bought lots of vegetables to make spaghetti with.
Dave showed up later at the same house! He had contacted the same warmshowers host.
In the evening I ate my home cooked spaghetti and talked with Tami and Kirk and played the piano for a while.
