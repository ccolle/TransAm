Astoria is the end of the TransAmerica trail and was my original end destination.
Today I was cycling there.
In the morning the legs were turning good and I swiftly road to Longview where I took a short break.

Next the route turned west, following the Columbia river downstream towards the ocean.
I had to face a strong headwind the rest of the day.
Approaching midday I passed two cyclists that were walking and after I inquired if I could help it appeared one of them had broken a chainstay.
When I was later waiting for the ferry over the Columbia river they showed up again.
We talked for a while, waiting for the ferry.
The two of them are brothers cycling the pacific coast route.
I took the ferry together with Brad while the other brother with the broken chainstay waited for a pickup from their parents who happened to be in the neighbourhood.

On the other side of the Columbia river Brad and I went to the restaurant in Westport and shared a table for lunch.
After that it was time for the final 40 km stretch to Astoria.
I cycled for a couple of minutes and a second spoke snapped in my rear wheel.
With two brokes spokes my bike was wobbling badly and at first I thought I wouldn't be able to continue.
I decided to give it a try anyway and carefully I pushed on, slowly and wobbly, towards Astoria.
Every km was a km less walking.
Amazingly my wheel held up the whole stretch to Astoria.
First order of bussiness was going to the bicycle shop there.
I was greeted by a grumpy old man who immediately started lecturing me about my spoke count being to low.
One of his colleagues fixed my wheel while I had a smoothie in the cafe nextdoor.

When I checked into the Norblad hostel Jake showed up.
He arrived in Astoria the day before and was staying in the hostel as well.
Later we went to the grocery store together and bought supplies to make spaghetti.
Back in the hostel we shared the kitchen with a every so slightly crazy guy preparing fish.
Later he opened a can of pickled jalapenos and after he ate some he rubbed his eyes and immediately started screaming and ran to the sink.
