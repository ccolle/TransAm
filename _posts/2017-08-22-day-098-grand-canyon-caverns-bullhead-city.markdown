For breakfast I went to the motel at the entrance to have the continental breakfast included in the camping price.
It was a buffet and let's just say I made full use of it.
The ride in the morning was a very swift one, mostly downhill and with a slight tailwind.
The heat was rising rapidly as I rolled into Kingman, around 11 AM the temperatures was already in the upper thirties.
First order of business was getting to a bicycle store to buy new tubes.
After getting them I had lunch in a closeby subway and figured out the route to, and campgrounds in, Bullhead City.
In the afternoon I had a hot desert ride and after a minor climb I descended to Bullhead city, only about a 100 m above sea level.
As I dropped in altitude I felt the temperature increasing and when I got to Bullhead city it was a searing 42 degrees Celcius, well over the comfort limit.

I checked into Camp Davis campgrounds at the Colorado river and made a quick run to the a small convenience store.
When I got back I was anxious to jump in the river as it was insanely hot.
After slamming down a pint of B&J's I had a very refreshing swim in the river.
The water is just the right temperature and is much warmer compared to when I tried it at Lee's Ferry in Marble Canyon.
In the afternoon I relaxed at the beach of Camp Davis.
I left my battery pack alone for a while, charging in the sun using its solar panel, and when I returned it was gone.
After some looking around at the spot I had placed it a young girl came out of an RV and handed it to me, with a rather guilty looking face, while her mother was watching from a distance.
In the evening I set up my tent right on the border of the Colorado river, and sat in the water for a while.
