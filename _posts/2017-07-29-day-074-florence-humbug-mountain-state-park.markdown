Similar to the previous day I woke up in an morning mist which quickly disappeared.
I packed up and had breakfast in the gazebo of the campground.
The route now went slightly more inland and for the most part of the day I rode through forests.
I passed several southbounders.
Just before North Bend I cycled over an impressive and very high bridge.
Most bridges here have a button for cyclists to push that activates warning flash lights.

Past North Bend I set my mind to having lunch in the subway of Bandon.
I had lunch there a bit later than usual, around 14:00 and a 120 km into the day.
After an extended lunch break I was back on the road, blown forward by a strong tailwind.
The km's flew by and I had an easy ride to Port Orford where I bought food before heading off to Humbug mountain state park, 10 kms further down the coast.
This last part treated me to a scenic and wide view over the bay, with large cliffs standing in the ocean, and Humbug mountain.
I did not brake a spoke today which, given the past few days, seemed almost exceptional.
After a nice hot shower at the campground I went down to the beach to watch the sunset.
