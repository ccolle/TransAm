For breakfast I had a leftover bagel with creamcheese and the delicious mango Felix had given me.
On my way out of town I stopped at a safeway for second breakfast and a woman, who thought cyclists wear silly shirts, wished me a safe trip.
At Fort Washakie I bought a snack and a couple told me that "my friends" were about 17 miles ahead of me.

At Crowdey's gasstation I had again a cheese-bean burrito.
Gradually the valley changed from green and grassy to a barren wasteland, littered with red rocky formations.
On a descent to a nice viewpont on these I saw two fluo dots pedalling in front of me.
A few minutes later I had caught up to them.
They were heading for Dubois as well.

I cycled faster and got into Dubois first.
I went to a store to buy bearspray and the store lady told me that her grandparents were from Belgium.
She could pronounce the "G" sound in "Brugge" and "Godverdomme" very well which is rare for native english speakers.
Here grandmother had been a champion in bow-and-arrow bird shooting.
She told me about a church that hosts cyclists (not listed on the aca maps).

I went out to look for it and saw 3 of the 4 riders I passed earlier.
Mike and Liz, brother and sister, and Dave, who I encountered way back in Virginia (between Christiansburg and Rural Retreat).
I told them about the church and when we found it Connie showed us in. There is a piano!
The four of us went to a laundromat to do our laundry together and while our clothes were spinning we went over to an icecream shop nextdoor.

In the evening Dave, Mike and I went to a cafe.
I had dinner while they only drank a couple of beers because they would cook their dinner themselves, back at the church.
Before bedtime I played the piano for a while and a late-arrival eastbounder showed up to spend the night there as well.
