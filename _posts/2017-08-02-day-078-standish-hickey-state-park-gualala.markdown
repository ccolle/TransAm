I was up early to beat the heat and by 6:30 I was on the road.
It was already warm enough to ride in short sleeves.
In Legett I started the climb out of the Eel valley towards the ocean.
It was a hard but scenic and quiet climb.
Once over the pass a very cold ocean brezze greeted me and I layered up.
The descent was fun on the windy road with lots of sharp curves.
At the bottom I rode through cold fog and after a second climb and descent I arrived at the pacific ocean again.
While I cycled down the coast more fog rolled in from the ocean and for the rest of the day I rode through a white haze, clearing intermittently.

In Westport I took a break and had two cookies and a croissant.
For lunch I already scoped a subway in Fort Bragg Where I arrived around 11:30.
Riding further south I passed 4 southbound cyclists.
If the fog hadn't been there I'm sure it would have been a very scenic ride.
When it lifted for short periods of time I could see imporessive cliffs, beaches and caves.

Around 15:30 I took a break in Point Arena.
In the store a lady walked up to me and said jokingly "boy, you really look out of shape".
She told me she had cycled from Point Arena to Los Angeles a couple of times when she was younger.
She proceeded to give me a banana with the advice that it's good for the muscles.
I hope she either owns the store of paid for it later or I am an accomplice to theft.

From there there were only 24 kms left to my destination for the day, Gualala.
I did groceries and had a nice converstation about cycling in the southwest of the US.
At the park of Gualala I set up in the hiker/biker spot and after dinner I read untill dark.
