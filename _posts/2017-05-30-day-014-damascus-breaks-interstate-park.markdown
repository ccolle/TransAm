I made full use of the extensive breakfast at the hostel.
As I was about to leave early bird and another hiker took a picture of me.
After a quick detour to the supermarket (food city) I was back on the TransAm.

After 40km the first big climb of the day started.
The hills have grown into mountains and the roads start turning with hairpin bends.
As I was catching my breath on parking at the top, two women drove up to go on a day hike.
When I told them I was cycling to the west coast they took a picture of me as well and said they would be praying for me and safe trip.

As my stomach started growling I passed the gas station of Hanoker which has a subway.
"A footlong veggie-delight, whole weat please", I said to the lady of respectable age behind the counter.
She asked which veggies I wanted and as usual: "A bit of everything except pickles and peppers".
She might have miscalculated the individual-vegetable-amount because when she was finished and looked at the mountain she had created, the bread barely visible, she exclaimed: "boy that's quite a mouthful!".

Not much later, back on the road again, the second major climb started.
At the top I was rewarded with scenic views and an awesome descent on a new, clean, wide, fresh, black road.
A car pulled up alongside me and a man shouted "there is a mobile home coming!".
I quickly got off the road and a minute later a house on a truck rolled down the mountain.

A while later I was chased by a very agressive white dog and it made actual contact with my bike!
It is fascinating how much of an adrenaline-power-boost you get when outrunning such a dog.

As I got close to my destination, Breaks interstate park, I saw a cyclist resting at the side of the road.
Scott from Chicago was cycling the TransAm as well.
We talked for a while and then I started riding up the final murdering steep climbs towards the park.
The view from the park on the Russel fork river is gorgeous.
It is called the grand canyon of the north, I have not seen the grand canyon but that might be a bit overstated.

On the campgrounds I encountered the Dutch couple I was told about back in Americamps, Richmond.
They are passionate cyclists and have cycled all over the world.
They are doing the TransAm for the second time!
