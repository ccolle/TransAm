I woke up to a grey and overcast sky and it was quite chilly.
Not too bad for the long climb back up to Cedar Breaks at 3200 m.
At panguitch lake I stopped for a snack just like the day before.
After a lot of climbing I finally reached the top (again).
At an overview point I met a very friendly couple who said I looked just like their son.
It was already 13:30 when I started the awesome descent to Cedar City.
I raced down the beautiful green canyon back down and overtook a car and a logging truck in one go.
Approaching Cedar City the canyon turns red and rocky again.

At Cedar City I went to the bicycle shop (finally!) to get my wobbly wheel trued and my jockey wheels replaced.
While the machanic was working on it I went to the subway 2 blocks away for lunch.
When the repairs were done I was back on the road, already well after 3 PM but I decided to ride another 70 km to Hurricane anyway.
Luckily it was mostly downhill.
Riding south from Cedar City I passed through a wide valley opening up as I approached Kanarraville.

In Hurricane I went to the RV park after grocery shopping.
The reception was already closed at 19:30 so I pitched my tent on the area designated as tent camping.
I was the only tent camper there and I saw a lot of sprinklers so I pitched my tent in a spot hopefully out of reach of them.
