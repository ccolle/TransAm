We had a quick breakfast on the back porch.
In the sunny morning we rode on quiet roads through fields and forests.
A deer graciously ran really close alongside us for a while.
At a gasstation in Olney a local advised us to take a "shortcut" which would save us at least 40 miles.
When we were later joined by another local this quickly shrank to about 10 miles on a tough road.
Mike and I decided to stick to the original route.

At Eureka I had lunch in a subway and a pint of B&J's in front of a supermarket.
When Mike and Dave caught up we continued and not long thereafter the enormous lake Koocanusa appeared.
We took the bridge across to the low-traffic side. The road alongside the lake is beautiful and very quiet.
It twists around and through rock formations and follows the border of the blue lake, occasionally diving into the dense pine forest.
I had run out of water and was very thirsty.
When I finally arrived at the campsite my throat was absolutely parched and drank several liters of water from a spigot.

After that I had a nice relaxing swim in the very warm water of lake Koocanusa and when I returned to the campgrounds Mike and Dave rolled up.
During the evening several other cyclists rolled in.
We had all suffered during this long and hot day and after dinner we quickly dropped down onto our sleeping pads.
