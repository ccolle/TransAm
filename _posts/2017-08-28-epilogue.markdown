When I landed my father greeted me at the airport and helped me unwrapping my bicycle.
It seemed largely unscathed and after replacing a tube I was good to go and I started cycling the very last kilometers of my 3.5 month journey to Ghent.
I had promised fries to all those who would bike along the Schelde with me to Ghent.
When we reached my home town I treated fries for the cycling enthousiasts and after a nice evening meal I cycled home.
