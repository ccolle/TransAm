Breakfast: with vanilla-flavoured yoghurt the oatmeal is actually not that bad, almost tasty even.
I set off to Yorktown victory monument, the official starting point of the Transamerica Trail.
Next I went down to the beach to perform the tire dip in the ocean as tradition requires.
The time had come to start the Transamerica trail.
The colonial parkway, connecting Yorktown with Jamestown, was very enjoyable wide road with low traffic.
It runs along York river, crossing over to James river.

In Jamestown the route followed the beautiful Virginia capital trail, a cycling highway separated from the road.
About halfway, when passing a cafe with a terras, a woman yelled "TransAm?".
"Yes" I answered. She shouted back "Maybe we'll see you in Charlottesville".
Later that day, when making my way around Richmond, a man rolled down his car window and shouted "TransAm?". I: "Yes!". He: "Well good luck to you", raising his two thumbs in the air.

I was not able to find th campsite I wanted to stop at and decided to continue to the next one.
After a long day in the saddle, at the 160km mark, I finally arrived at "Americamps RV resort".
I received a very warm welcome at the reception and the woman at the reception, impressed with my day's milage, decided I was allowed to stay free of charge.
I was told that a lot of cyclists visit this campsite as it lies on the crossing of the east-west transamerica trail and the north-south eastcoast trail.
I was invited to the social activity of that eveving: "make your own ice cream", which appeared to be free icecream with as much toppings as you can fit on it.
I sat down at a table with a retired couple (whose names I already forgot, shame on me, I think it was Peter and Darlene).
Peter used to work on a nuclear submarine, operating the nuclear reactor, awesome!
Darlene quickly became very worried about me and told me I should be very careful and call my mother frequently.
When saying goodbye she even gave me a hug with a concerned look in her eyes.

Later that evening I walked 20 minutes to a restaurant which appeared to be closed.
Luckily a domino's was right across the street.
As I walked back to the campsite the woman of the reception (and her husband? He also works at the campsite) passed me and offered me a ride.
