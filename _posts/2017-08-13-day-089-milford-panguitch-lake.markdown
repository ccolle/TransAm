After a night's sleep I decided to fly back home from Las Vegas in two weeks.
Sadly the prices seemed to have gone up by at least a 100 euros.
I booked the tickets online via my smartphone and later made the calls to Condor and Lufthansa to make sure my bicycle could be carried on both the Las Vegas - Frankfurt and Frankfurt - Brussels flights.
After a late start and saying goodbye to an emotional Renee I was battling my way into headwinds towards Cedar City.
The last 30 km before Cedar City felt tough and I was having a hard time.
At the gasstation's subway just before Cedar City I took a long lunch break.
I met Tad, a trucker, there who was very impressed by my cycling travels and after asking if it was allright for me he lifted me up in prayer.
Cedar City has a bicycle store but it is closed on a Sunday so my wobbly wheel would be wobbling a bit longer.

It was already 3 PM but with only about 90 km on the counter I decided to tackle the huge climb towards Cedar Breaks at 3200 meters.
I turned into a canyon and after a few kms the vegetation changed completely.
Trees and green grass appeared and later dense pine forests as I climbed up the scenic canyon.
It was especially nice to ride through after the shadeless and hot Nevada desert of the past few days.
It was a very long and steep climb but I didn't mind that as I was presented with nice landscapes and ever more scenic and far reaching views as I climbed higher.
At the top I gazed upon the amazing red rock formations of Cedar Breaks monument.
Around 19:30 I finally went over the pass and 40 minutes later I arrived at Panguitch lake where everything had just closed and I was almost out of food.
Luckily a restaurant owner saw me standing sadly outside and he sold me a tiny pizza and a coke.
Combined with the few slices of bread I still had left I could satisfy my hunger to acceptable levels.
As darkness rolled in I set up my tent at the USFS campsite and turned in shortly thereafter.
