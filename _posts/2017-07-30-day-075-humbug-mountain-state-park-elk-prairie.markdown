When I woke up it was really warm and I feared for a very hot day but as I left the Humbug mountain valley it quickly cooled down to normal temperatures.
About 30 km into the day I snapped spoke number 9.
the ride in the morning felt slower and harder than usual.
After about 85 km I rolled into Brookings and had lunch in the subway there.
When I left the wind had turned into a strong side/head wind from the south west.

Just south of Brooking I crossed the state border into California and had to wait to get my picture of the "welcome to california sign".
I continued and cycled a bit further inland and made my way down to Crescent City passing quiet little rural towns along the way.
It appeared that the cycling shop in Crescent City was closed on Sundays so I kept riding with a broken spoke.
After a quick stop in a gasstation I entered the giant redwood forest south of Crescent City.
The trees are unbelievably large and insanely high.
Riding into the forest I got the impression of seeing an ancient forest from dinosaur times.
It was too bad that the road was not very nice to ride on.
A busy 2 lane road with no shoulder at all.

Feeling tired and hungry I descended towards Klamath.
In the gas station I ate a nice veggie-burrito and bought some food.
I wanted to call it a day and find a camping in Klamath but after seeing all the "luxury camp resorts" I decided to ride another 20 km to the the state park in the redwoods.
I climbed back into the forest and was again astonished by it.
These trees almost seem from another planet.
When I approached the campground I passed a cyclist Canadian couple.
After a quick photo shoot in a hollow tree trunk I finally arrived at the campground, a 195 km into the day.
The place is called Elk Prairie and at the reception there was a large male elk herd grazing right next to it, only a couple of meters away.
It was already after 7 so after a shower, dinner and setting up camp it was already bedtime.
