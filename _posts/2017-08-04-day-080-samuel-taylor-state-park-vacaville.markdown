I had a nice ride further along the valley and at Fairfax I started seeing a lot of cyclists on the road.
It seems that this is a popular route from and to San Fransisco.
After a windy climb out of Sausalito I saw the Golden Gate bridge.
At the viewpoint there were a lot of tourists and I had to wait to take a picture.
The ride over the bridge was cool but involved a lot of tourist dodging.
At the other side I took some more pictures and then followed the coast into downtown San Fransisco.
I climbed up the insanely steep Lombard street (straight part) and at the top I was congratulated.
Next I descended the famous windy part of Lombard street and continued to Fishermans wharf.
After some double backing and searching I managed to buy a ticket for the ferry to Vallejo.

I had lunch in the subway close to the ferry building.
At 14:30 the ferry left and I had a very scenic boat ride out out of San Fransisco, passing Alcatraz as well.
Once back on two wheels in Vallejo, I rode through its somewhat shady looking suburbs but when I left them behind me I was riding through yellowbrown grasslands with a nice tailwind.

In Vacaville I went to the house of my warmshowers host for that night, Patrick.
He was working late so he left the door unlocked.
I made myself with dinner with the groceries I bought in the Walmart of Vacaville and for the first time in a long time I had B&J's for dessert instead of afternoon snack or dinner appetizer.
