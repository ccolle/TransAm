I wake up to a very thick morning mist.
Everything left outside had become very wet.
As I ate breafkast the sun rose and the mist disappeared.
In the first part of the day I climbed a beautiful section of the old Pacific highway 101.
There was practically no traffic and I had a nice quiet morning ride through the woods.
On the way down I passed two day-cyclists.

After a snack in Licoln City the route brought me back to the ocean.
Again I was confronted with breathtaking views over the pacific ocean and the rugged cliffs.
After a short side trip to the Yaquina head lighthouse I rolled into Newport and went to the bicycle shop to get my spoke replaced.
At the bike shop I met Evan, a triathlete, who was very enthousiastic about meeting a Belgian and knew all about cyclocross in Flanders.
While my spoke was being replaced I went for lunch and Evan drove me to a good mexican restaurant before heading off to the pool.
I was the veggie burrito's were only 5$ and decided to order 2. Big mistake.
They are absolutely huge and I tried me best but could finish the 2 logs.

I walked back to the bicycle shop and the repairs were just about finished.
I left and after another 20 km another spoke snapped.
That brings the total to 8.
There is a bicycle store in Florence, where I was heading that day.
In the afternoon I pushed hard to get there on time, luckily aided by a nice tailwind.
The route took me up and down steep cliffs with nice views around every corner.
I stopped at "sea lion caves" to the the sea lions and then quickly rode on to get to the bike store before closing time.
I got there about 30 minutes before they closed and luckily the owner agreed to replace my spoke.
About 10 minutes later he was done, which is insanely fast.
Next I went to the campgrounds in town, that offered a special price for bikers/hikers, and relaxed for a while in the gazebo where I charged my electronics and had dinner.
Just before sunset I set up my tent and crawled into my sleeping bag.
