Everybody in the hostel got up and left before me.
I had a slow start, had breakfast and nice hot tea (english breakfast).
I updated my journal using the computer, so much faster and easier compared to my phone!
I could not resist to watch some youtube videos as well.
Around 8 AM (the others left between 6 and 7) I decided to pack up and get going.
After another cup of tea of course.

Around 8:45 I was finally on the road again and was met by the strong headwind of yesterday.
The menu for today was more hills and forests.
Another dog chase happened around 1 PM.
I stopped at a diner in the tiny town of centerville.
When I asked for something without meat the waitress looked confused and after she checked the menu she reported that she could offer me grilled cheese (a grilled sandwich with cheese).

I had planned a shorter ride today and around 14:30 I arrived in Ellington.
I had trouble finding the small and unmanned hostel and had to call twice for dieections.
Stephen, the Texan guy who had stayed in the Farmington hostel as well, arrived half an hour after me.
After he got installed we went to a pizza place and shared a "giant pizza".
In the evening the two other cyclists who stayed at the same hostel the previous night, Amanda and Harrison, rolled up.

The hostel itself is very basic.
One room with four field beds and a bathroom.
We turned in for the night around 9 PM.
