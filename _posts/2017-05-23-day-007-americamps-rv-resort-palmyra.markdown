I left the Americamps just before 7 and was headed for Palmyra.
The day before I contacted Elizabeth via warmshowers and received the reply that I was welcome to stay the night.
She even asked if I was a vegetarian for dinner!

As the day went on I rode back into the hills of Virginia, gradually increasing in height.
I stopped for lunch in Mineral, standard protocol: buy food in grocery store/supermarket and eat it in front if it (this time no food lion !).

Light drizzles started falling from the sky as I approached Palmyra.
When approaching my destination the rain was increasing.

I was welcomed very warmly by Elizabeth when I arrived.
I could place my bike on the porch, protected from the rain.
Once inside I was greeted by Malia and two tibetan terriers.
I was offered hot tea and fresh homemade banana bread.
When I asked where I should pitch my tent Elizabeth told me that there was a bed available for me.
I was very grateful especially since it was still raining outside.
Elizabeth showed me her room and bicycle, it looked like a full-blown touring bike.
For dinner we had homemade pizza, courtesy of Malia, and egg-plant parmesan, delicious!
Afterwards we had pleasant talks about, among other things, cycling and future bicycle plans.
