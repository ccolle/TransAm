Rest day (and memorial day)!
This hostel is perfect for a rest day.
During the night I slept like a baby.
Breakfast is served between 6 and 9 AM and includes waffles, eggs, potatoes, toast, banana,...
In the morning I said goodbye to J&J as they took off to Tennessee, diverging from the TransAm trail.

I did my laundry (for the first time) and let it dry on the washing line while I read on the back porch.
For lunch and dinner I ate the spaghetti I made yesterday.

Around midday new hikers started arriving, among which "early bird" and ishkebabbel (or something similar).
The afternoon included a nap between 4 and 6 PM.

I'm looking forward to get back on the road tomorrow.
