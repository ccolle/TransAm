After a good night's sleep I went to the supermarket and had breakfast in front of it.
In the morning I crossed into Arizona and started the long gradual climb towards the Grand Canyon.
I soon felt fatigued and was having a hard time.
In Jakob lake I ordered a thick shake (basically icecream) and two of the "famous" cookies.
I took a quick midday nap in one of the sofas in the lobby while my phone charged.

Back on the road the route took me through an alpine looking environment where pine forest and green meadows followed each other up.
At the gas station of Kaibab lodge I had another snack and a drink.
Not long thereafter I entered Grand Canyon national park.
After battling some more hills through the pine forest I arrived at the north rim lookout point.
The view is absolutely amazeballs.
The sheer size and depth of the canyon is mind boggling.
After admiring the view for a while I set off to the campgrounds there.
I was happy to hear they have hiker/biker spots for only 6$.
Furthermore I was the only hiker/biker there and could pitch my tent in a spot with a direct view over the canyon.

After I pitched my tent I went to the conveniecnce store and had some chips and a soda while trying to upload my strava ride on the terribly slow wifi there.
At sunset I ate dinner on a bench close to my tent, overlooking the grand canyon and watched the sunset.
