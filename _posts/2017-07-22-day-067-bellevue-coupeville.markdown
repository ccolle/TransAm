In the morning Jim made pancakes for breakfast and later straightened my disk rotors in his huge workshop/garage.
I played the piano for just a couple of minutes and by 9 AM I was on the rode.
The ride through the suburbs of Seattle was much nicer than expected.
Traffic was very low and there was a lot of greenery.
It was Saturday and their were a lot of cyclists on the road.
On a cycling trail a group overtook me very slowly and I started talking with one of them for a while as we were riding along a river.
In Snohomish I followed the centennial trail all the way to the end, north of Arlington.
In Arlington there is a subway and it just so happened that I passed it around lunchtime...

In La Conner I visited a bakery recommended by Judy called Calico Cupboard and had a piece of delicious carrot cake.
After that I briefly got back onto the Northern Tier route only to leave it again a couple of miles further to take up the Pacific Coast route.
I rode over the imporessive deception pass bridge and had a nice view over the pacific ocean.
I followed the coastline in the low hanging golden sun.

Patrick, a warmshowers host in Coupeville, replied to my request to stay the night I sent in the morning.
Coupeville was a bit further than anticipated but I pushed on to 185 km despite the late start.
I arrived just before 8 PM in Coupeville and it quickly became clear it had been well worth it.
Patrick had made dinner for me, including delicious hoemade bread.
He lives right on the lake border and has amazing views right out of his back windows.
At night we talked for a while and Patrick told me about his cycling adventure through Canada and about the hidden cycling trails Whitby Island has to offer.
