I ate the last of my food for breakfast and left the main part of my gear at the campsite before climbing to paradise.
On the way up low haning clouds rolled in and I was climbing through fog, only seeing my immediate surroundings.
Luckily it cleared up somewhat as I climbed higher and there were some nice but somewhat limited views.
Sadly there was no sign of Mt. Rainier at all.
I bought some very expensive food at the visitor center as there were no alternatives.
At the top it was pretty cold and I had a somewhat uncomfortable descent due to that.
The sun broke through for a moment and on the way down I could see the beautiful green valley I had climbed out of in the previous hours.
The high mountains towering above me remained shrouded in the clouds.
Back at Ohanapecosh I packed up the rest of my gear and started the climb north on the 123.

I met a cyclist from California on the way up.
He told me about the organisation SOB (seniors on bicycles) he was a part of and showed me his SOB flag.
After the scenic climb up I decided to continue to Greenwater and not go to sunrise, looking at the dark grey menacing clouds. 
I arrived there very hungry around 5 PM and immediately bought groceries at the small grocery store.
Next I went to one of the two bars in the small town and ordered a veggie wrap.
The bartender was very impressed by my cycing adventure and after I told him that I was looking for a campground nearby he called to the other bar across the street.
He informed me that I was allowed to camp behind that bar, with access to the restrooms for 10 dollars.
I gladly accepted.
I left the bar and he said me hot tea was on the house.

I paid the 10$ at the bar and decided to go for a veggie burger because I still felt hungry.
Later I tried out the horribly out of tune piano in the bar for a short while.
When I started feeling tired I went to my designated camp spot and set up my tent.
