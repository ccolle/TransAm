I ate breakfast in front of the conoco gas station.
I was a bit confused as why it wasn't open yet so I could use the restroom and refill my water bottles.
Later I learned that Arizona doesn't do daylight savings time so it was an hour earlier than my clock showed.
Out of Cameron I started the long climb up towards the south rim of the Grand Canyon.
It was very cloudy which was quite nice.
Again I passed many Navajo craftwork stands on the side of the road.
I entered the Grand Canyon national park and a car passed me with some french sounding tourist that cheered me on.

At the desert view lookout I had a stunning view over the Grand Canyon.
The rock formations are spectacular.
In my opinion the south side is slightly more impressive compared to the north side as you have a wider view over the canyon and you can see the Colorado river at the bottom.
At desert view I had a veggie-burger sandwich as second breakfast, a bag of chips and the second gatorade of the day.
In the following hours I passed many viewpoints along the south rim.
Around noon I arrived ate Grand Canyon village and had a nice breakfast burrito for lunch.
I took shelter from the thunderstorms that were rolling in.
About an hour later it seemed they had passed and I continued south towards Valle.
On the way out of the park I ran a flat. On closer inspection it appeared to have been a pinch flat int the rear wheel which seemed strange as I had checked the pressure a few hours before.
As I descended towards the wide open plains dark clouds appeared on the horizon and as I got closer I saw non-stop lightning strikes all over the place.
I was very worried about getting caught in the storm and I full throttled to Valle while the lightnings came closer and closer.
Luckily I had a tailwind and I rolled into the Flinstone's campground at Valle just before the storm hit.
After checking inI went to its diner and had another veggie burger as it was the only vegetarian option.

After dinner, when the storm had blown over, I set up camp.
The campgrounds looked kind of shabby with old bus wrecks and I suspect quite a few abandoned trailers.
I pitched my tent next to the only other tent there and locked up my bike (which is quite rare).
As the sun set a double rainbow (all the way) appeared in front of the dark clouds.
