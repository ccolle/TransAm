In the morning Noah and I went to "the bunkhouse" in Fowler for breakfast.
It is a very cozy place and the food was delicious and plenty.
All the bread and pastry is homemade.
I had a (huge) cinnamon roll, a chocolate covered donut, a breakfast burrito with eggs and potatoes and a cup of tea.

On the way to Pueblo it started raining lightly and it was extraordinarily cool, only 12Â°C.
We rode into Pueblo and the bicycle store there was the first priority.
I dropped off my bicycle for the spoke repair and I went together with Noah to a mexican restaurant across the street.
Two tostadas later Noah set off to a coffee shop to wait for his host to become available and I went back to the bike store.
The tires I ordered had now arrived as well (bontrager hard case lite AW-1).
The old, original tires have performed very well, 11500 km with only a single flat.

Next I went to the warmshowers host I contacted the night before and Michael welcomed me as I pulled up in front of his house.
I replaced my front tire (the rear was done together with the spoke replacement in the bicycle shop) and had trouble getting decent pressure into it with my pump.
Michael lent me one of his which performed much better and he told me to keep it.
In the evening Michael gave me a walking tour through Pueblo and we went to a very nice restaurant with loads of vegetarian options.
