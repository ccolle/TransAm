After an early rise I rode down the thickly forested valley towards Enumclaw where I had second breakfast.
It consisted of bananabread, strudel and a huckleberry smoothie.
Next I set course towards Snoqualmie and Northbend to see some Twin Peaks landmarks.
Just before Snoqualmie I got on the US18 which was a big mistake.
It is a very busy road with a lot of trucks and by times the should would dissappear completely while the guardrail force me onto the road.
It is probably the most unsafe I had felt so far on the trip.
Luckily there were some traffic jams later offering more comfortable riding for those part.

When I arrived in North Bend I went to Twede's cafe (double R diner) for lunch.
I ordered the "famous" cherry pie for desert.
I texted Judy to let her know I was in North Bend.
A few minutes later Jim called me and we agreed to meet at Snoqualmie Falls in 2 hours.
After lunch I looked for the school which was the police station in the series but did not find it.
Onto "Ronette's" bridge then.
When I was admiring the Snoqualmie Falls Jim rolled up behind me and together we cycled to Bellvue.
Judy welcomed us and she showed me around their house.
After a shower I discovered a concert piano in the living room and played it for a while.

For dinner Jim and Judy were invited elsewhere.
They dropped me off at close friends of theirs who were happy to host me for dinner.
John used to race bicycles and knows an insane amount of information about the tour de france.
After dinner we watched a summary of the Col d'izouard stage.
John drove my back to Jim and Judy's house.
Judy had given me a key so I could enter.
I turned in for the night not long thereafter.
