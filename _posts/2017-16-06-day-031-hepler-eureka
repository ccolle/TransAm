In the morning I made French toast using the large kitchen.
After playing the piano for a while I decided to get going.
With a (rare!) slight wind blowing west I was rocketing at almost 26 km/h.

After the sun broke through the clouds the wind turned to a strong sidewind from the south.
Around midday a spoke in my rear wheel snapped.
The next bicycle shop is in Newton, 200 km away.
After removing the broken spoke I continued, checking the wobble, and possible increase of it, continuously.

I took a break in the shade to espace the burning sun for a moment and a guy in a FedEx truck pulled over and handed me some ice water.
North of Toronto I stopped at a gasstation to rehydrate in the murdering heat and met a TransAm racer inside.
I was invited to sign the cyclist guest book and received a companion lizard.

The last stretch towards Eureka was brutal. The sun was grilling me merciless on the wide open and shadeless prairies as I was struggling on.
When I rode into town Jake texted me informing me about a good place to stay in Eureka, Robyn's cycling house.
Perfect timing!
I called Robyn and I met her at the courthouse of Eureka.
She gave me the house key and explained to me how to get there.
After I went there, unpacked and took a shower, she came by, put on a movie for me (the internship), finished cooking the meal I started preparing and baked a delicious pineapple cake.
Around the time I was getting ready to sleep two other cyclists, a brother and a sister (eastbounders) arrived. We did not have the chance to talk very much because they immediately left again to go to the store before it closed and I was feeling very tired and went to bed.
