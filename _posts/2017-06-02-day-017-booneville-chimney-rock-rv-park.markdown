Scott and I got up around 6 AM. 
I packed faster and set off to the nearby gas station for breakfast.
I bought water and an agg-cheese biscuit.
When I left the gas station Scott just rolled in.
The early morning offered a very welcome cool mist.
The forecasts predicted a 30 Â°C day.
The hills had become noticably smaller compared to the previous days.

At McKee I went to the save-a-lot (supetmarket) to buy food.
There I ate second breakfast because the single biscuit of this morning was not nearly enough.
I had bagels with cream cheese and was reminded of the breakfast with Elizabeth in Palmyra.
That is only 10 days ago but it feels longer.

On the approach to Berea, a descent on a wide road, carved through the hills, gives you a far reaching view over the seemingly small rolling hills of Kentucky.
It induced the strong feeling that the Appalachians were behind mee forgood.
I arrived at Berea around 12:30 and went to the subway just north of it.
I ordered the usual veggie-delight (the only vegetarian option btw).
They always offer to toast the bread and cheese but this was the first time I could detect crispyness in the bread and meltynessin the cheese.
The best veggie-delight to date!
Two times a man came up and inquired about my trip.
They both wished me a good and safe journey.

Through the hot afternoon I rode over the gentle rolling hills of Kentucky, covered with fields and fences.
At 5 PM I arrived at Chimney Rock RV park, at the bored of a lake.

Dog chase report: 6 chases in total, oddly enough always two dogs at a time, interesting...
I had to pas one duo two times as I missed a turn.
Second time they were ready for me. They got close!
On the other hand, 1 pair of labrador-like dogs were very friendly and seemed to enjoy running alongside me.
They did not bark once, and kept looking back at me to make sure they were not running in my way.
