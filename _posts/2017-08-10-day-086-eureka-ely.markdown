In the morning I saw one bicycle but two tents so I was a bit confused.
One of them was awake early as well and gave me a head nod as I was eating breakfast.
The way out of Eureka was immediately more climbing.
It was still early and with an easy pace I rode up the mountain.
After a nice descent into another wide open, vast and barren valley and crossing it I climbed up the mountain side on the other side.
The sun was climbing and it was starting to burn.
My arms were already a bit red from yesterday and I desperately tried to catch up with cloud shadows, which mostly did not work out.
After another descent I started the third and last climb of the day.
Although it was a short day the last 20 km into Ely felt hard.
I guess the legs were still tired from the very long day the day before.

First order of business in Ely was lunch, in the subway of course.
Next I went to the supermarket to buy eyedrops because my eyes were very red and hurting.
Today I rode with my glasses instead of my contacts.
Maybe next time I will not wear my contacts 10 days over the month-limit.
After that I went to the sports store to get my spoke fixed.
The bicycle mechanic was a high school kid.
I think he has never replaced a spoke before because he took over an hour and my wheel was still untrue and wobbly after the repairs.
He didn't use the trueing stand that was right there on his workbench.
It seemed he realised he hadn't really fixed it because he didn't charge me anything.
After talking to him for a while I learned I was his very first customer... just my luck.
The next bicycle shop is another 300 km away, lets hope my wheel holds up.

I cycled to the KOA campgrounds 5 km south of town and passed the supermarket again to buy dinner and breakfast.
I arrived at the KOA around 4 and had a shower and did laundry.
In the evening I talke to 2 other campers and one of them said it was her first time camping ever.
