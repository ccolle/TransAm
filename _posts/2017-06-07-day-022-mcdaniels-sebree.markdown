I slept very well at Cheryl and Allen's place. In the morning Cheryl made scrambled eggs and toast for me.
She invited me to stay longer but the road was calling me.
I said goodbye and thanked them for their incredible kindness and hospitality.
The journey to Sebree took me through never ending tobacco, corn and wheat fields.
The number of dog chases remained limited to 2 and none of those raised my heart rate considerably.
Also, a man pulled up to me and yelled something about reflectors? I'm not sure, did not quite understand him.

Around 3 PM I arrived at the First Baptist Church Cycling hostel in Sebree.
The accomodation is amazing.
It has a huge room with a tabletennis,pool,airhockey and foosball table!
A large kitchen, showers and washing machine and dryer are at oir disposal as well.

Nadim and Samy are staying here as well.
They are doing a 600 mile piece of the TransAm.
The priest told them I was coming (I called ahead in the morning) and they accounted for me when they bought ingredients to cook dinner.
Delicious spaghetti and a salad.
There was also a large bucket of ice cream already present in the fridge.

Nadim and Samy are brothers who came from Lebanon to the US in the seventies.
Samy is a professor in computer science (but is actually a mathematician) and Nadim is specialized in agriculture and has worked for the UN and the world bank.
Later that evening the priest visited us, and asked if we had everything we needed.
Together we watched a basketbalgame.
