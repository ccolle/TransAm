Melvin and Keiko replied affirmatively on my warmshowers request last night, fixing the endpoint of the day to their home in Ellensburg.
Just outside of Entiat I passed a large cliff with symbols and flags painted all over it.
I rode into Wenatchee to go to a bicycle shop and have my spoke replaced.
The way into Wenatchee was super nice thanks to the cycling path along the river.
I arrived 5 minutes before opening time at Full Circle Cycling shop.
The shop keeper told me it would take at least an hour as he had some urgent things to do first.
I settled into a corner next to some power plugs and waited while my electronics charged.
Just over an hour later the mechanic had replaced not only one but three spokes.
One of them, that was previously replaced, was apparently way too long.
I was charged only 20 dollars.
I was anxious to get back on the road because it promised to be another very hot day.

On the gentle climb to Dryden I rode again through many orchards that look like perfectly square green patches on a yellow-brown background from a distance.
Every single piece of green vegetation here is heavily irrigated.
I had a large lunch in the Big Y Cafe and gave all to easily in after seeing the "homemade pie" sign.
With a probably way too full stomach I started the real climb of the day, heading south on the US-97.
The scenery changed to a rocky valley covered with pine trees which offered welcome shade from time to time.

The route took an exit off the 97 onto a small unmaintained road that goes straight over the mountain where the US-97 curves around it.
The small road is quite rough and is littered with potholes but there is practically no traffic and the views are very pretty.
I went up a very scenic but hard climb and was suffering in the heat.
I ran out of water and the closest refill opportunity would have to wait to Ellensburg as the campgrounds along the road had no water and the only restaurant was closed.

After the descent, another minor climb appeared but feeling very tired and dehydrated it felt very tough.
Luckily it was all downhill to Ellensburg after that and at the first gasstation I quenched my thirst with a lot of gatorade.
A man with a bike and his dog came up to me and was very interested in my travels.

As soon as I arrived at Melvin and Keiko's the front door magically opened.
They welcomed me warmly and gave me more water and offered to do laundry and gave me the wifi password before I even asked for anything.
Keiko is japanese and I would have liked to try out my japanese but the opportunity did not arise.
Keiko put different snacks on the table and I learned that she and Melvin are avid bicycle tourers.
They have toured in Ireland, England, Eastern Europe and the Balkan, Japan, South East Asia, New Zealand,...
It was very interesting to listen to all their adventures.

Later the neighbour from across the street joined us for dinner.
We had pizza outside and he was delighted to see my Eddy Merckx cap and told me Eddy is still #1 in number of days wearing the yellow jersey in the tour de france.
Before I went to sleepp Keiko made me some cinnamon tea.
I went to sleep on a large and comfortable bed.
