I left the hostel a little before 7 and started cycling the 
adventure cycling association's "tidewater potomac heritage route" counterclockwise.
It took me past the Licoln memorial I visited yesterday on foot.

At the border of Washington DC, with its many stoplights finely calibrated 
to make sure a cyclist will gaze upon the red light shining bright and proud, 
I got on a cycling hihgway along the Potomac that would make the dutch jealous.
A scenic road along the west bank of the Potomac, crossing forests and swamps via wooden bridges completely devoid of any motorized traffic.
This ended at Mount Vernon and soon I found myself sharing the road with big American cars.
Some roades had 4 lanes each way!
From time to time a "cyclist lane" would appear, only to dissappear 100m further.
At least it was reassuring that I was allowed to ride there.

As the heat was increasing a fellow-tourer appeared in front of me.
When I caught up to him I was greeted with a big smile.
Christian from New York, but actually from Colombia, was cycling from NY to Key West, Florida.
It soon turned out that our routes overlapped and we joined forces.
At our first break he gave me an intense green coca-marihuana paste for my hurting knee, claiming it did wonders for his.
As I was applying the coca-marihuana paste, Christian lighted his pipe, smoking pure marihuana.
Continuing onwards we started braving the densely forested rolling hills of virginia.

I decided for an early stop in order not to overtax my knee.
Christian and I drove to the oak-ridge campsite.
Christian, somewhat displeased with the campsite and low on food,  decided to press onwards towards Key West.
