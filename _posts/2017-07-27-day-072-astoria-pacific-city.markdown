I had planned to eat the last of the spaghetti for breakfast but it had disappeared.
I was ready to go around 6:45 but then I noticed the reception only opens at 8 and I needed someone to nlock the bicycle storage.
Luckily I saw one of the staff members (he is a huge fan of Eddy Merckx) around 7 and I was on the road by 7:15.

The first stop of the day was the Astoria column up on the insanly steep hill.
It is the official start or end point of the TransAmerica route.
A bit later I noticed a noise in my rear wheel and discovered another broken spoke.
This time I didn't hear or feel it snapping.
That makes a total of 7 spokes so far.
Luckily the wobble in the wheel was almost unnoticable.

In the morning I cycled along the pacific coast with its huge white beaches.
Further down the road I passed a couple from Murcia, Spain cycling the pacific coast route.
In Tillamook I had lunch in the subway and after lunch I ignored some "road closed" signs to take the scenic three capes route from the start.
The views over the ocean and beaches are breathtaking.
The route is very hilly, climbing the high cliffs offering far reaching views, and descending to white beaches.

During the whole afternoon the views kept amazing me. Around 17:00 I arrived in Pacific city on the Oregon coast, did groceries and went to the city park.
