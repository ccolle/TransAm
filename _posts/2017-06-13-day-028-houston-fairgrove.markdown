For breakfast I went back to Jamie's kitchen and ordered scrambled egss and "hash browns" (fried spaghettified potatoes) and biscuits with tea.
When I set off it was already very hot and humid again.
Not much later I passed Stephen who ate breakfast elsewhere.

My breakfast started feeling very heavy in my stomach and I was burping continuously.
I stopped in Bendavis for a coke in an attempt to appease my stomach.
While I was relaxing at a table a little kid walked up to me and asked if I wanted to see a baby bird.
Without waiting on an answer he showed me a newborn bird in his hand and I almost choked on my drink.

At noon I arrived in Hartville and was feeling very nautious.
My appetite had completely dissappeared and I was considering calling it a day there.
After elobarate hesitating I decided to try to continue anyway, partly because I already had arranged a warmshowers stay in Fairgrove that night.
Luckily the wind turned into a slight tailwind and was pushing me forward.

At 4 PM I arrived in Fairgrove and saw Jay smithing in his workshop, hammering red hot steel.
When he saw me he turned off his machines and showed my the house.
My appetite still hadn't returned which was disquiting given the whole day of riding without eating since breakfast.
He went back to his shop to finish some work while I took a nap in the couch.

Later Jay prepared a fantastic evening meal, and although not very hungy, I enjoyed it.
When Kelly came home from a late night meeting we watched a blacksmithing show/competition before I turned in for the night.
