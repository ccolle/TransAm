After a good night's sleep I got out of bed only around 8 which felt like sleeping in.
Jake had already left for Seattle.
For breakfast I prepared a load of french toast.
During the morning I watched a lot of youtube clips, the wifi was very good.

After lunch (spaghetti from the day before) I replaced the handlebar tape on my bicycle and checked the rear shifter cable for wear.
It seemed OK.
The afternoon was spent updating my journal (paper version) and watching some more youtube.
Dinner consisted of the same spaghetti again.
