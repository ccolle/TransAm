As we left left lake Koocanusa we stopped at a viewpoint overlooking the lake and Libby dam.
On the way to Libby I ran my first flat on my trip.
A pinch flat which probably could have been prevented if I had checked my tire pressure...
In Libby we took a long brake in a coffee shop.
From there we rode to the impressive Katenai waterfalls.
In a calmer side pool of the wild and rushing rapids we had a swim in the cold water.
Back at the turnout of the waterfalls we had a cold drink and were back on the road.

It was very hot and the sun was burning hard.
South of Troy we took a very welcome break at a bar/restaurant, I was out of food and very hungry!
Dave showed up quite late, he had blown his tire and had patched it with duct tape.

With renewed energy I cycled further down the narrow and green valley of Bull river.
Mike ran a flat, that made all three of us having a flat in the same day!
I arrived just in time to go to the grocery store at the intersection of US200 and US56.
The sold soft serve icecream and I ordered a 20 ounce cup, which is apparently a substantial amount of icecream.
I went to the USFS Bull river campground and picked out a nice spot at the border of the lake and texted Mike and Dave.
When they arrived we had a nice refreshing swim in the clear water.

In the evening we went to the nearby bar and met an Australian couple cycling the northern tier eastbound.
We did not hold back when ordering food and ate a lot.
