In the morning I made my way futher down the coast.
The landscape has gradually changed and the vegetation has become yellowbrown grass, covering the hills with patches of green around little streams.
I climbed and descended the hills alongside the ocean untill I stopped in Bodega Bay for lunch.
I went to a small restaurant in the port and had mushrooms and a pizza.
I made use of the wifi to buy the ACA maps of the Western Express route, that will lead me from San Fransisco to Cedar City in Utah, where I will pick up the Canyon Connector route.
At least that is the plan...
After lunch I turned slightly inland and after some hard climbing I rode through a beatiful narrow and windy valley to Hamlet.

In Point Reyes I bought groceries and began the last 15 km to the campground.
It was a very nice ride through a quiet forested valley and for the last few km I followed a bicycled trail.
When I arrived at the campsite I saw the cycling couple that I met at the previous camping in Gualala.
They had taken the bus to Bodega and started cycling from there.

Over dinner I had a nice conversation with another cyclist who had been on the road for a similar amount of days as I had and we talked about some of our adventure.
