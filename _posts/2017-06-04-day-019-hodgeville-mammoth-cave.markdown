We got up around 6 AM.
The tour group wanted to go to Licoln's birthplace and had to wait untill opening hours.
I was packed extremely fast as I left my bags on my bicycle and my tent was already packed as well.
I said goodbye to the tour group and started cycling towards Mammoth Cave.
This part of the TransAm is an optional side loop.
After a while I looked at the time, was confused, and concluded that I had driven into a new timezone.
When I approached Mammoth Cave the blue sky turned grey and it started raining.
I arrived at the campsite around 11 AM and luckily the rain stopped.

Next I went to the visitor center to buy a ticket for a tour in the world's longest cave!
The place was awfully touristic but the cave very impressive.
When we resurfaced we were greeted by thunderstorms and heavy rain.

Opening my plastic food bags to eat dinner I saw that something had eaten my bread again...
Raccoons? Squirrels? There are a lot of squirrels around Mammoth Cave.
I bought some snacks in the camp store and sought shelter under the roof behind it.
