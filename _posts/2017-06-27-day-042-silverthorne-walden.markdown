I had set my alarm for 5:20 because we had planned for a long day towards Walden.
Bruce was already awake and took a picture of us before he left.
We had kind of a slower start and were on the road by 7.

The morning offered a sweet gentle downhill with a soft tailwind all the way to Kremmling.
The ride down brought us through a beatiful valley and a large lake at Heeney.

I stopped for a snack at a gasstation in Kremmling and saw Noah crossing the street a few blocks down.
He was heading for a coffee shop.
I rode onwards to Hot Sulfur Springs and passed through the impressive Byers canyon.
The railroad at the bottom of the canyon follows the twisty Colorado river at the bottom.

At Hot Sulphur Springs I ate a microwaved bean-cheese burrito and met a couple that had been cycling for fourteen months!
They started in Sao Paulo Brazil and are making their way up to Canada. "Only" two months left...

After that it was time for the 90km stretch towards Walden over the Willow Creek pass with no services along the way.
The way up went very smooth, by times aided by a nice tailwind..
A aca (adventure cycling association) van passed me on the way up.

On the way down from Willow Creek pass the road turned right into a fierce headwind, when descending into a wide and open grassy valley.
Progress became difficult and cycling into the terrible headwinds was hard.
A haze started covering the sky and later the whole sky had become white and visibility was somewhat limited.
The theory is that the strong winds had carried smoke from far-away forest fires.

A couple of kilometers out of Walden my rear shifter cable snapped (again) and I was forced to finish the day in my highest gear.
It was tough considering the hills that had appeared combined with the gusty winds.

When I arrived at the city park of Walden, feeling quite tired, I saw the aca van again.
I had ran into the supported aca TransAm tour.
They were camping in Walden city park as well.
I went looking for the driver named Chris to ask him if he had a rear shifter cable I could buy off him.
He was busy cooking dinner and invited my to join, promising to look at my bike after the meal.
I met the members of the tour over dinner (there was a vegetarian so I had veggie-burgers).
They are all very friendly and seemed like a cool group.
One of them had ridden the bikecentennial back in '76.
Jake arrived later and was offered the leftovers from the dinner.

After we were done eating Chris spent half an hour fixing my bike while I was lighting up the workplace with my cellphone flashlight.
He replaced the cable for me and would not take any money.
Exhausted from the long day I quickly turned in for the night thereafter.
