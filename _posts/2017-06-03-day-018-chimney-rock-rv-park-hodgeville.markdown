The cool morning mist dissappeared quickly as the heat rose.
Riding through the large fields I made good progress.
Around Springfield I suddenly saw a cyclist standing at the side of the road.
I stopped and shouted "Hi!".
She jumped in the air, almost dropped her map and looked frightened at me.
She was part of a self supported guided TransAm tour.
She was trying to figure out the route directions.
I showed her the way and set off.
Throughout the day I passed another four of the thirteen members of the tour group.

At a crossroad in Loretto firemen were raising funds and they gave me a bottle of fresh cold water.

I arrived at the Larue county Park in Hodgeville and was guided to a large empty sportshall where I could stay, restrooms and showers included!
The tour group I passed earlier arrived one by one.
Most of them (weirdly enough) preferred to sleep outside.
The tour guide, Emily, and two others decided to sleep in the sportshall as well.

Around 7 PM I went to the Mexican restaurant across the street.
I was served by a very annoying waiter who wanted to know how much people make in Belgium.
The food was good and plenty though.
When I got back I read for a while before going to sleep.
