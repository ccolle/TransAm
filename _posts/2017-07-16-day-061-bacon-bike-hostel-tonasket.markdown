I woke up around 5 AM and made a buttload of french toast with the bread and eggs I bought the day before.
Dave had brought the maple syrup on my request.
After that delicious breakfast I left first and said goodbye to Dave and Mike as I was planning to ride further that day then they did.
The following days I would veer off the Northern Tier to go see Mt. Rainier while they would continue to follow it.

In the cool and quiet Sunday morning I descended towards Kettle Falls.
I crossed the wide Columbia river and started the long climb towards Sherman pass.
On the way up I passed two other cyclists, a girl that started cycling in Idaho and was heading towards Seattle and later an older man for who the gradient and the length of the climb had forced him off his bicycle as he was pushing his bike up the mountain.
Around 11 AM I finally made it to the top and after that it was a long descent all the way to Republic.
On the way down I started thinking about lunch and what did I see when I rolled into town?
A subway sign! My joy was quickly turned into disappointment when I saw it was closed.
When I rode through the town in search of food everything seemed closed.
I quickly learned that there was a planned power outage that day.
Luckily the gasstation had a generator and was still open.
Lunch consisted of cheese-tater tots, a bag of chips and a gatorade.

After the lunch it was more climbing towards Wauconda pass.
Next I left the dense pine forest and descended into a yellow brown grassy desert valley towards Tonasket.
Due to the strong headwind I had to pedal hard most of the way down.
During the descent a spoke snapped in my rear wheel again, fourth time already.
I planned to stop at the bicycle shop in Okanagan the next day.

In Tonasket I checked out the cyclist-only camping spot behind the visitor center first and bought breakfast for the next day.
After that I went to the subway as it had been denied from me for lunch.
The guy in front of me ordered a pizza and I decided to give it a try as well.
It tasted very good.
I set up my tent in the back garden of the visitor center and read for some time while a neighbour was playing his guitar and singing loudly nextdoor.
