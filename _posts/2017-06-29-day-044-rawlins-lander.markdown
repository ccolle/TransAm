I set my alarm for 5 AM as I planned to ride to the next town on the route, Lander, 200km away, and the weather forecast had predicted headwinds.
Cities are spaced quite far apart here.
As the sun appeared over the horizon I was packing up my tent and ate breakfast.
At 6:15 I was on the road.
In the morning I cycled up a slight incline into noman's land.
Suddenly a wide and barren valley appeared below me with no signs of civilization except for the road I was on.
The wind was laying low for the moment and I was happily pedalling across it, impressed by the remote and empty landscape.
Just before Lamont Felix and his wife passed me, honking and waving as promised.

I cycled up the other side of the valley, through "Muddy Gap" and stopped at the gasstation bearing the same name.
I had a microwaved bean-cheese burrito while I saw a cyclist dressed in yellow, on a recumbant pulling a trailer ride in.
I forgot his name but it starts with a "J" for sure. Let's go with Jake.
Jake is riding the TransAm eastbound and we exchanged some tips about the route ahead.
The yellow suit he was wearing appeared to be protection from the mosquitos.

I drove on westwards through wide valleys lined with rock formations.
I passed two more eastbounders and stopped at Jeffrey city to eat lunch.
I ordered a coke at the bar and had my water bottles refilled.
The bartender was very friendly and told me that the snowtopped mountains I saw appearing on the western horizon belong to the wind river mountain range.
He said that the wind almost always blows east to west but that up to that moment of the day the winds had been pretty calm.
The headwind had indeed been not that bad but it still was pretty noticable.

On the way to Sweetwater station I saw a kind of gazelles and fox-like creatures roaming the valley.
At Sweetwater station, a 150km into the day, I refilled my water bottles and noticed the wind was increasing in strength as I saw the flags flapping wildly.
A moment later I saw dark clouds overhead and all of a sudden the temperature dropped and an icy northwest wind pounded my right in my face.
I arrived at a beautiful viewpoint over the rocky hills and what looked like a gorgeous descent down them.
Signs promised a gradient of -6% over 8 miles.
Sadly, due to the strong and gusty headwind, I had to push on the pedals all the way down.
Around the 160km mark it starting raining and the wind kept hindering me greatly.
I was snailing along in my lowest gear.
In these remote mountainous areas there is little or no shelter and at a time like that I wondered why I had decided to embark on such an adventure.

About an hour later the sky was clearing up and the wind lessened in intensity.
The last descent of the day guided me on a windy road through beatiful red rocky hills.

I was very happy to see the Lander-city-limits sign after 203 km, 12 hours after I left the campgrounds at Rawlins.
First I went to the public pool for a shower and then went to a bar for an extensive dinner.
There was wifi, which has become a necessity as data reception is very rare in Wyoming.

Lander has a large city park where everyone is welcome to camp in and when I arrived there were already numerous tents set up.
I pitched my tent and sat outside for a while.
When the sun had set I went to sleep.
