Landed yesterday evening at 19h00 in Baltimore.
My bicycle was swiftly returned to me.
Luckily it looked largely unscathed.
Taking my bicycle on the train to DC was another story.
I missed the first MARC train by a few seconds, the traindoors closing right in front of me while sprinting down the stairs.
2 hours later, when the next MARC train arrived I was told bicycles are not allowed on it, and should take the next AMTRAK train.
30 minutes later the AMTRAK conductor told me that bicycles were not allowed and I should try the MARC train.
Arriving to the logical conclusion that it is impossible to take my bicycle on the train I took a taxi.
Half an hour later and 70$ poorer I finally arrived at the hostel in DC around 23u00.
