As breakfast I had the leftovers from yesterday evening.
Samy challenged me for a tabletennis match.
He is a good player and it was so much fun we almost forgot we had to go cycling.
I left just before them and said goodbye.

The first part of the day offered a soft bit welcome tailwind.
Around noon I arrived hungry in Marion, and as luck would have it, there is a subway!
The staff was rather unfriendly and difficult to understand.
Thanks to my acquired subway experience I could deduce what they were saying.

The route turned north towards the Ohio river and I was faced with a headwind.
While waiting on the ferry a couple took a photo of me and I of them.
They are from Georgia and on their way to Illinois to ride their horses they were transporting in their trailer.
They offered me gatorade and granola bars but I had plenty of water and still digesting my veggie delight.
The ferry took us across the Ohio river into Illinois.

In the afternoon I cycled the scenic way along the Ohio river towards Golconda, with a pitstop in Elizabethtown.
In golconda I bought bread and a snickers icecream bar and went to the nearby campgrounds.
