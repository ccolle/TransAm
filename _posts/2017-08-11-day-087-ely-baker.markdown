I planned a short day as the next town is only about a 100 km away but the town after that is another 130 km.
In the morning I steadily climbed straight into a headwind.
After the first pass I descended into another wide open valley.
I passed a windmill park there, quite a rare sight in the US.
After crossing the valley I descended into the great basin valley and later turned off the US-50 whih I have been riding for the past 4 days.
It was only a couple of km downhill to the small town of Baker from there and I arrived around 11:30.

I waited in front of one of the two restaurants in town untill it opened at 12 and had a veggie-burger.
After that I rolled to the campgrounds that had a sign in front of it, welcoming cyclists!
In the afternoon I sheltered from the head in the laundry room and watch youtube videos using the wifi.

When my stomach started growling again I headed for the other restaurant, passing the small convenience store to buy breakfast for the next day.
The restaurant was a bit fancy.
I had a delicious pizza with white sauce, potatoes and rosemary.
When the waitress told me about the chocolate cake with icecream dessert I could not refuse.
Back at the campgrounds I hung out in the laundry room again untill bedtime.
