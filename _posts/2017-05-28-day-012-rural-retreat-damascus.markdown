My little tent had succeeded in keeping me and my gear dry through the tunderstorms during the night.
The forecasts predicted more thunderstorms in the afternoon so I got up before 6 AM. When I rolled down to the entrance of the campgrounds J&J were preparing to get going.
Their were aiming for Damascus as well.
The first hours were spent climbing Mt rogers, located between Rural retreat and Damascus.
Luckily the incline was low and easy.
I passed several Appalachian Trail (AT) hikers as the trail crosses the road a couple of times and runs through Damascus.
After a beautiful descent, following a mountain river, I arrived at Damascus around 11:30.

I went to a bicycle shop and when the mechanic was investigating the problem the rear shifter cable snapped!
It looked like I arrived just in time.
The shifter cable was replaced while I had lunch nextdoor.
I was then off to a hostel.
I checked in at Woodchuck's hostel.
A very cozy and homey hostel, it is practically a normal house.

Some time later Jake arrived at the hostel.
He checked in as well and said he had lost Jonathan.
We both had no reception and were unable to contact him.
When Jonathan finally arrived he explained he had taken a wrong turn forcing him to do an extra 14 miles.
He decided to go to another hostel in town.

In the afternoon Chuck, the owner, drove us to a grocery store and I decided to cook my own meal tonight (spaghetti).
The hostel has a comfy back porch looking out onto a nice garden.
There I ate my self made dinner and talked with Loon, Bald Eagle and Summercamp.
AT-hikers give each other trail names...
In the evening I had the chance to do some reading, it had been a couple of days.
The predicted rain and thunderstorms stayed out during the whole day.
