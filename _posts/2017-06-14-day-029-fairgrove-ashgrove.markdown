After a good sleep in the very comfortable bed I still didn't feel a 100%.
Jay prepared a nice breakfast and after a fotoshoot I was on my way.
A headache quickly popped up and I was struggling to cycle up the hills.

In the morning a TransAm racer passed me. Evan Deutsch in position #1, 2800 miles in after 11 days!

Around midday I arrived in Ashgrove and went to Pennington's supermarked to buy lunch.
When walking through the aisles a lady, Wendy, walked up to me and asked me where I'm from and about my travels.
She offered me to stay in the cycling hostel she was running together with her husband Mike.
Although it was barely 12 I accepted as I felt tired and weak.

In spent the afternoon napping in the couch.
Around 5 PM Amanda showed up. Harrison was making a detour through Springfield to get a new lens for his camera and would arrive later.
Wendy and Mike later came by to say hi and made sure we had everything we needed.
They are heavy supporters of the TransAm race and told us that Janie Hayes, the #1 woman, would probably come sleep for a few hours.
Around sunset Harrison arrived.
Shortly thereafter I crashed on my inflatable matress.
Between 10 and 11 PM Janie arrived for a short sleep in the hostel.
