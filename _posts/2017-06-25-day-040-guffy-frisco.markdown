When I went outside in the morning I stood face to face with a deer which did not seem to care much about my presence and I quickly went back inside to get my phone to take a picture.
Jake left but I was in no rush getting ready and was enjoying my first cold but beautiful morning in the mountains.
I packed my stuff and had breakfast (peanutbutter and hazelnutter sandwhiches).

The morning offered a gentle climb towards the a wide open and beautiful valley north of Guffy, route 285 runs through it.
In hartsel I stopped at a gasstation and Jake exited a diner nextdoor where he ate breakfast.
Together we rode to Fairplay where we had lunch in front of a supermarket.
After that it was time for the climb of the day to the highest point of the TransAmerica Trail, Hosier pass.
The elevation is 3500 meters but because we were already quite high we only had to climb a good 500 meters out of Alma.
The gentler gradients of the longer climbs suit me much better than the short but steep hills of Western Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and of the Ozarks of Missouri and I had no trouble conquering the pass.
At the top I waited for Jake to show up, we took eachothers picture at the "Continental Divide" sign and then it was downhill to Breckenridge.

I descended faster and later we met again at a subway in Breckenridge.
Breckenridge seems like a very touristic place and almost feels like a theme-park town.
In Breckenridge I went to a bicycle store to get new disc brake pads because they should have been replaced already a long time ago.

From Breckenridge to Frisco we followed a very nice bicycle trail, seperated from the road.
We arrived at a beautiful lake and set up camp at Heaton Bay campground.
Next we followed the bicycle trail further to Silverthorne to have dinner.
In Dillon Dam Brewery we shared a table with two other cyclists who were participating in the Great Divide race.
A self supported offroad race that follows the Rocky Mountains from Canada all the way down to New Mexico.
After having a delicious dinner they followed us to our campground and we shared our spot with them.

Jake managed to straighten a wheel of one of the racers and not long thereafter we all turned in for the night.
