I rode to the nearby Walmart in the morning and ate breakfast in front of it.
A couple of sugary pastries later I was on the road.
I took a break in Elma and had a bean and cheese burrito for second breakfast.
On the way to Centralia I ignored a couple of "road closed" signs.
When I got to the roadworks the workers were luckily nice enough to stop digging and let me pass.

In Centralia I had lunch in the subway.
After that it became very hilly towards Toledo.
The scenery here is nice, patches of forests and fields but it is nothing compared to the previous weeks.
Above the treetops I could see Mt. Rainier off in the distance.

In Toledo I went to the grocery store to buy dinner and breakfast for the next day.
In ate dinner in the pavilion of the city park while my electronics charged from the electrical outlets there.
I set up my tent in the city park as the sun was setting and went to sleep quickly after that.
