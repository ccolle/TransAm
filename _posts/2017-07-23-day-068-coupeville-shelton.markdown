Donna from Sheltn had replied on my warmshowers request I sent last night so Shelton was my destination.
After some cereal and tea for breakfast Patrick and I cycled to the Port Townsend ferry.
In the first few miles I snapped a spoke again (fifth time).
We leared that the 7:15 and the 8:45 ferries had been cancelled due to the strong tides and had to wait untill 10:15.
In the meantinme Patrick showed my around Fort Casey's impressive historic defenses which never have been really needed.
Around 10:45 we finally arrived in Port Townsend and I said goodbye to Partick and thanked him for his amazing hospitality.

In port Ludlow I had lunch, only a 30 km into the day.
I ordered a custom sandwich in the supermarket and the friendly lady behind the counter was impressed by my cycling adventure and told me she and her husband were considering a "barge & bike" trip in France.
Next I had a long afternoon cycling through the hilly Bremerton Peninsula passing numerous small bays and lakes.

During the last part of the day I was tired and suffering a bit on the rough road around Mason Lake leading to Shelton.
I was very happy to arrive at Donna's place and she was already waving at me when I started searching for her house.
Another cyclist that started in Alaska arrived a couple of minutes later and together we picked some fresh veggies from Donna's garden.
and ate them with her homemade bread.
At night we talked for a while but I was feeling tired and didn't last very long.s
