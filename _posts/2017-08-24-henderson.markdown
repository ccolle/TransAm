When I told Rick my flight back home was the 27th of august and I had no fixed plan yet to spend the next 3 days he said I could stay at their place until the 27th.
I accepted thankfully.

Thursday Rick and I went to see the new Planet of the Apes movie in a theatre that is part of a casino.
As I expected salty popcorn is the default here.
When we returned Andrea had made dinner and I ate my first corn cob.

Friday Rick invited me along to go and appraise a few houses and I was promptly promoted to his assistent when we visited different houses.
After a nice tour around the neighbourhood we went to Ikea to have lunch.
It looks exactly the same as the one in Ghent.
In the evening Rick got a phone call and unexpectedly scored some tickets to a football game of the university Andrea and he studied at.
The tickets were for the best seats in the stadium.
Rick invited me to come with and not much later we were in the car heading towards Brigham Young University (BYU).

In Saint George we had dinner in a golden corral and I made full use of the all you can eat buffet.
Rick told me quietly that the group at a table next to us were polygamists and when I "subtlely" looked over there were indeed a lot of women and only a few men.
From there we rode to the home town of Rick where we could stay at his parents' house.
An unfortunate rabbit decided to try and cross the road in the wrong place at the wrong time and the collision made a huge dent in Rick's car.
A headlight was hanging loose and some of the plastic was scraping over the road.
Rick had to patch it up with nails and duct tape.

After a comfortable night's sleep we continued to BYU in Provo.
We stopped at a gas station for breakfast and Andrea felt less guilty about buying a doughnut when I showed her I had bought three.
In Provo I met one of the daughters of Rick and Andrea and the four of us went to the football game, first passing by the campus.
Andrea bought a BYU tshirt for me there so I was able to always be reppin for the cougars.
Next we went to the huge stadium of BYU to watch the game.
It was very interesting to see a football game in real life instead of seeing it in hollywood movies.
The sun was burning hard and there was little or no breeze so I think all of us were at least a bit relieved when the game was over.

On the way back we had stopped at a subway and I had my last sub there.
In Saint George we went to a hardware store to buy bubblewrap for packing up my bike and to a Walmart where I bought my last cheap, American B&J's.
When we got back to Henderson it was already late and I quickly turned in for the night.

The next morning I was up early and bubblewrapped my bike.
After breakfast Rick drove me to the airport and helped me carry my luggage to the check-in.
I had to sign a damage-waiver for my bike because it wasn't boxed.
I thanked Rick again for his awesome hospitality and said goodbye.
