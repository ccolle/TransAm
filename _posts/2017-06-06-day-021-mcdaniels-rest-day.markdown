Rest day!

In the morning I laid all my gear that got wet in the thunderstorm out to dry.
The sun was cooperating and it promised to be a hot day.
I cleaned the drivetrain of my bike and read my beautiful camping spot.

Around noon Allen came to the campground to pick me up.
We put my bicycle in the back of his truck and drove around the lake, visiting scenic places in the neighbourhood and fancy houses he has helped building.
We ate lunch in a gas station restaurant. I decided to try out "cheese sticks".
It appeared to be a pizza with nothing but cheese on it and instead of the regular pattern of equal circle sectors it is cut into rectangular pieces.
After some more sightseeing we went to Cheryl and Allen's home.
The room in which I could stay was very nice.
Later we went to Rough River Dam Resort for dinner.
We sat outside and as the night fell the abundant fireflies started blinking.
