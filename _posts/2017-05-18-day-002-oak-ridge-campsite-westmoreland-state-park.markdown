When I went to sleep yesterday evening I was startled by a sudden noise.
Through the transparent mesh of my tent I saw a raccoon inspecting my bicycle.
Luckily I ate the last of my food earlier that evening so there was probably nothing the raccoon would have liked to steal, and I closed my tent back up.

The next morning the first order of business was finding breakfast.
I packed up everything and drove to the nearest supermarket; a food lion, which appears to be the Americanized delhaize.
After eating my breakfast on a bench in front of the food lion, the day could begin.

The first part of the day I rode on smooth black roads with a bright yellow double stripe in the middle, meandering through forests and over hills.
As I passed Fredericksburg the road widened to a 55 mph double lane one which diminished cycling comfort considerably.
Although I should mention that most cars were leaving a big gap when passing me, sometimes driving completely on the other side of the road.

I pulled over at a gas station to refuel on water.
There I looked up more information about possible campsites and learned that the closest one was overpriced and RV focussed.
The next possibility was 50km away, which would make my day total a 140km.
Onwards I went through the burning sun and intense heat (34Â° C).
Around 5 p.m. I arrived exhausted at the campsite.
When riding into the campsite it became clear that it had been well worth the effort.
It is located in a forest on the bank of the Potomac, and after following the windy road down to the river I discovered a beautiful beach, part of the campgrounds.
Swimming was promptly promoted to priority #1.
The potomac is already wide enough here so that the other side is barely visible.

Later that evening, after eating my evening meal, I made the mistake of leaving my food unattended.
When I returned I heard creatures, prime suspect #1: raccoons, hurrying away.
There went my bread, hazelnut spread and even my chocolate cookies.
Darkness quickly set in and I turned in for the night.
