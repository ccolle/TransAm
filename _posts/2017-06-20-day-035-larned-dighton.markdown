I got up and left before Noah.
In the morning I made a short detour to see Fort Larned.
The wind was blowing strong from the south west which meant an annoying head/cross wind all day.
Later I passed Amanda again.
At Rush Center I stopped at a gas station to buy water but when I entered a few heads turned my way and it quickly became clear that this was a gasstation without a shop.
However I received free icewater from the cooler box.

Around 13:00 I arrived in Ness City and had a nice lunch with a mango smoothie.
I decided to do another 50 km to Dighton, this time my legs seemed ok to go.

Dark clouds appeared on my way to Dighton and I saw lightnings flashing in the distance.
I pushed hard and got to Dighton just before the storm hit 
I went to the city park, changed into more comfortable clothes and went to a local diner, sheltered from the rain.
I saw Noah rolling into town from the diner and when I returned to the city park pavilion both Noah and Amanda were there.
The public pool had opened (ot was closed when I arrived) and I went there for a shower.
When the sun had set we turned in for the night.
