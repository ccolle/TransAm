Strong winds had blown and shaking my tent all night so I slept badly.
Around 5 AM all three of us were already awake.
I was on the road around 6 and was instantly hammered in the face by the wind.
The first three hours I averaged around 12 km/h while pushing hard.
I crossed into colorful Colorado and not long after that I snapped a spoke again in my rear wheel.
I guess I'll be wobbling to Pueblo, a good 200 km away...

At Sheridan lake I stopped at a gasstation and found Noah inside.
I had delicious homemade bananabread with pecan nuts.
Amanda arrived a few minutes later.

After resting a bit Noah and I left together and teamed up in the headwind, taking turns in the front.

As the morning progressed the wind became weaker but the heat set in.
After a hard 40 km from Sheridan lake to Eads we went to the subway of Eads for lunch and to escape the heat.
When clouds appeared we got back on the road.

The wind turned to a rare north wind and when the road turned south west we finally had a tailwind.
The clouds became darker and the wind grew ridiculously strong after a short but intense burst of rain.
When the wind was a full tailwind we were riding at 50 km/h with ease and we rocketed from Haswell to Arlington.
The wind decreased in intensity as the afternoon progressed but remained a nice tailwind and we pushed through all the way to Fowler, making the total distance 222.5 km for the day.

In Fowler we went to a diner called "Phat Willy's" and I had the vegetarian salad of the house and a grilled cheese with fries.
Noah went outside to make a call and there he started talking to Doug, the owner of Phat Willy's.
He offered us his caravan, parked behind the diner, to stay in for the night.
After installing in the caravan we turned in for the night.
