After a quick breakfast I was on the road towards Okanagan.
I was making good time due to the downhill terrain and a slight tailwind.
The valley of Okanagan river looks like a dry desert except for the green strip that runs along the river.
In Okanagan it appeared that the bicycle store was closed that day and I was forced to continue riding with a broken spoke.
On the way out of Okanagan I left the Northern Tier route and took the old US-97 highway towards Pateros.

I rode through endless apple, pear and cherry orchards.
I descended to the mirror-like Pateros lake and had an amazing veggie sandwich in the Sweet river bakery.
They had macaroons as well which I could not resist.

Next I followed the Columbia river down to Chelan where I took a break at a gasstation.
I had a nice converstation there with someone from Alaska who is dreaming of cycling the Continental Divide trail.
I made my way along the south side of the huge and touristy Chelan lake.
There are a lot of boats and other watercrafts on the lake.

A short climb out of the lake basin brought me into a small corridor valley leading me back to the Columbia river.
At Entiat, located on the Columbia river, I bought groceries and went to the city park campground that sits right on the border of the river.
