Harrison and Amanda are early birds and got up around 5.
Stephen and I remained in horizontal position on ourfield beds u till 6.
I ate breakfast and left at 7, just before Stephen.
It was already quite warm outside.

Afteran hour and a half I saw Harrison and Amanda at the side of the road.
They were fixing Harrison's punctured tire.
After making sure they had everything they needed I continued.
The weather was very hot and humid and the road swirled over the hills like a rollercoaster.
No flat parts at all.

I had a snack in a gas station in Eminence and had another break further down the road to see Alley spring.
I was sweating like a horse in the very hot and humid conditions.
I passed a firetower and climbed to the top.
It provided a wide view over the surrounding forests.
Not much later I passed two eastbounders, a Brit and a Dutchman, who started mid-april in Oregon.
I recommended climbing the fire tower.

The hills were becoming less steep as I rode into Summerville where I had lunch at a gas station.
No meat option: a "Bronco stick" (cheese) and deep fried potato wedges.

When I arrived at Houston I went to the police station to ask permission to camp in the city park.
Next I stopped at an icecream saloon for a much needed drink.
Roy, the owner, was very welcoming and gave me iced tea and real grandma's peanutbutter cookies free of charge in exchange for a photo of me in front of his store, to post on facebook.
When I left he refilled my water bottles and said to come back the next morning for breakfast, promising waffles and pancakes.

When I got to the city park I saw there was an open-air public pool.
3 dollars later I was jumping of the diving board.
After the pool closed I went to a subway for dinner.
Crispy, yummie but variety of veggies was less than amy subway I've encountered before.
When I sat outside, eating my veggie-delight, I saw Stephen pulling out of a Hardee's down the street.
I met him at the city park when I got back.
We set up our tents under the pavilion supplied with water, electrical outlets and light.
In the evening sun I read for a while.
