O boy what a ride

As we got further and further away, 
it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, 
the
 most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
