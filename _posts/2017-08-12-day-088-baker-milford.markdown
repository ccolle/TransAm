This day had the long stretch without services, a 130 km to the solitary desert.
In the morning I cycled on the US-21 up the great basin valley.
This road is more desolate than the US-50 and about one car passed me every hour.
I crossed into Utah in the morning.
The heat rose and it quickly became very hot.
On my way through the barren desert a chinese guy pulled over and asked if I could use water.
I was exactly half way and this was the perfect time for a refill.
I gladly accepted. He asked for a photo together and after saying goodbye I rode onwards.

When I went over the second pass of the day dark clouds appeared and down in the valley it started raining and hailing.
All off a sudden a lightning cracked right above me.
The sound was very loud and simultaneous with the flash.
I was the highest point in the wide flat valley and the risk of getting struck frightened me so I dropped my bicycle on the ground and crawled into the ditch on the side of the road while the rain and hail were pouring down.
A few cars passed me before one pulled over to check if I was ok.
The man confirmed that my situation was quite dangerous but he rode on as other cars appeared behind him.

When the thunder seemed to rumble a bit further away I carefully rode on, constantly checking the clouds above me.
The climb on the other side of the valley couldn't be over to soon and for a moment I got worried as the road turned towards the dark and thundering clouds.
Luckily the descent lead me away from them and I arrived safely in Milford and went to a Mexican restaurant and had a nice veggie burrito with fries.
I went to check the city park where I was planning to sleep and was disappointed by the rocky and dusty area with no sign of a restroom in sight.
Luckily at just that time Renee from Milford replied to my warmshowers request and after calling her I cycled a couple of blocks to her house.

It was not a very nice time for her as she recently lost her husband and sold the house so half of the furniture was wrapped up already.
It is amazing that she still finds the time and energy to host cyclists.
She made a bed for me and went back to packing.
I started looking at possible return dates and flights back to Belgium in the afternoon.
For dnner I went to the subway only 2 block away
