I decided to go for a rest day. 
My knee did not agree with the 160km of the day before.
The campsite is ideal for a rest day, there are free breakfast waffles between 8 and 9 am 
and a fitness room, TV included, that nobody is using.
My rest day was spent napping in the sofa, reading and watching friends and family guy.
In the afternoon I went to the CVS pharmacy to get eye drops and to the food lion (once more!) for food.
