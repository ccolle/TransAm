After a quick breakfast I was on the road around 7:00.
The mmorning sun was just rising over the pine tree tops and colored everything golden-orange.
The first half of the day was, like yesterday, climbing up Carson pass.
On the way up there were many roadwords with long waiting lines.
At one I noticed I had a flat tire just as we were allowed through after waiting for 20 minutes.
A metal wire had worked its way through the tire.
After a quick tube replacement and some more waiting I started climbing again.
The ride up was very beautifuland at the pass at 2600 meters I was very close to the snow covered mountain tops.
The descent down was fast and fun.
I left the dens pine forests and was suddenly presented with a vast overview over the brown, dry valley below.

I Woodfords station I had a sandwich which was way too small according to cyclist standards so 40 km later, in Carson City I had a veggie patty sub for second lunch.
On the way to Carson City I cycled into Nevada.
Next I visited a bike shop there to buy additional water bottles given the long stretches of desert I would be riding through the following days.
I also bought a new very bright tail light.
The mechanic also looked into a mysterious squeeking noise and quickly located the source: the pulleys.
He cleaned and regreased them and told me to order new ones.

Next I rode blazingly fast, with a strong tail wind to Dayton, did groceries and set up my tent in the State park.
A major thing I noticed since entering Nevada is that gambling is huge here. There are lots of casinos and even the supermarkets have slot machines.
In the evening I had lots of time to read in my Kindle.
