As the sun rose above the treetops I left the campsite and bought a couple of snacks at a convenience store at Panguitch lake which was luckily already open.
I aimed to have a descent breakfast in the town of Panguitch and after a swift downhill 30 km I had french toast and a hot chocolate milk.
After a nice slow breakfast I rode towards Bryce Canyon.
On the way there I rode through "red canyon" and had a very scenic ride through the red rock formations.

Around 12 I rolled into Canyon City "est. 2007".
After a quick snack at a gas station I cycled into Bryce Canyon national park.
I follwed the bicycle trail and was wondering where the Bryce Canyon was hiding between all the trees.
Then I turned off the trail and cycled a short stretch to the "rim trail" and was suddenly presented with an epic view over the amazing and abundant red rock pillars of Bryce Canyon.
I cycled along the rim, on the rim walking trail (I think you're not supposed to cycle it) to the various viewpoints.
It was an insane bike ride, on the rim with the steep slopes down to the bottom of the canyon right beside me, but the views (and the challenge) were well worth it.
Only at the very last and highest viewpoint a Ranger said I was not allowed to cycle there and after a final lookout over Bryce Canyon I returned following the paved roads.

Just out of Canyon City there is a subway where I had lunch.
In the afternoon I rode back through Red Canyon to Panguitch and went to the KOA campground there.
In the evening I had dinner at the same restaurant I had breakfast in that morning.
I updated my written journal as I was again running a couple of days behind.
