It was a beautiful morning, when I left Christiansburg the sky was clear and already at 7 AM too hot for long sleeves.
On the road to Bradford I crossed loads of oncoming cyclists. There must have been some kind of cycling event.
When I got to the supermarket in Bradford, Jake and Jonathan greeted me at the entrance.
They had found a place to pitch their tent at a firestation 10 miles outside of Christiansburg the day before.
To their taste the TransAm took too many detours and were planning to go to Rural retreat via shorter but undoubtly busier roads.
I was aiming for Rural retreat as well.
I set off to follow the TransAm over the steep hills and faced a strong headwind again.

Around midday I crossed Eric, who started in San Fransisco in early march and was heading for Yorktown.
He asked me "Is that your cycling buddy?" and when I looked behind there was a cyclist coming our way.
He was doing the TransAm as well.
When we said goodbye to Eric he raced off before I could talk to him...

In Whyteville I was feeling tired and hesitated too call it a day there, but looking at the time, only 14:30, I decide to go the 20km to Rural retreat.
On my way into Rural retreat my rear shifter started acting up and I was unable to shift into higher gears.
Manually pulling the shifter cable seemed to work sometimes.
I hoped to get to Damascus the next day, it has bicycle shops.
I called ahead to the nearby campgrounds to make sure there were available spots, given the memorial day weekend.
There was.

At around 8 PM (I arrived in at the campsite around 5) J&J arrived escaping the rain and thunderstorms.
