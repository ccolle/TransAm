By 6 AM Keiko had prepared breakfast with eggs and fresh fruit.
When I was about to leave Keiko handed me a brown paper lunch bag.
I was on the road by 7:30 only to realise 3.5 km later that I had forgotten my bear spray.
I returned and found it, hidden between the bed and the chest at the foot end.

The roud south to Yakima led me through a beautiful canyon with a wide but fast flowing and turbulent river at the bottom.
Approaching Yakima I could already see Mt. Rainier on the horizon, still over a 100 km away.
After a quick stop in Yakima (grape flavoured gatorade is not very good) I made my way west towards Mt. Rainier up the Naches river.
I decided to keep the lunch bag Keiko prepared for dinner as I spied a subway in the town of Naches.

During the day I passed again through a lot of orchards.
Out of Naches the route turned to follow the Tieton river and the landscape changed to green pine forest with a milky white blue Tieton river.
After a quick scary sprint through a dark tunnel I arrived at the large and scenic Rimrock lake, surrounded by vast pine forests.
When I left the lake behind me the gradient suddenly picked up and I started the final climb of the day up towards White pass.
At the top there was a very nice viewpoint on the valley of Rimrock lake.

On the descent at the other side I went around a corner and was suddenly smashed in the face by a magnificent view on the huge Mt. Rainier.
This has to be one of the most impressive mountains I've ever seen.
At a viewpoint I started talking to a guy from California and later he introduced me to his (disabled) wife.
They seemed happy to meet me and honked enthousiastically when they passed me further down the descent.

I rolled into the huge Ohanapecosh campground and cycled all the way to the back where the walk-in spots are and set up camp next to a cyclist couple, Judy & Jim, from Bellevue next to Seattle.
We talked for a while and after giving me some advice about routes around Mt. Rainier they invited me to stay with them in Bellevue if I would decide to pass by there.
For dinner I opened the lunchbag Keiko prepared and discovered sanwiches and yummie goodies: chocolates, an apricot and a nectarine.
