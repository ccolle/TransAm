Tammie made an egg-potato oven dish and a fruit salad for breakfast.
Like yesterday the first part of the day offered a serious climb.
After making it over Badger pass, west of Dillon, I descended into a quiet and isolated but beautiful and green valley.
On the way to the second pass (Big Hole pass) I passed a couple of eastbounders.
The next descent lead me into another scenic valley.
The grass fields were full of purple and yellow flowers and further west rose the snow peaked mountains that seperate Montana from Idaho.

I rolled into Wisdom around 12.
I had agreed to meet up with Mike, Dave and Liz there.
I found a shop/cafe with wifi and a playable piano and ordered smoothies and cookies while I waited for them.
Around 4 Mike,Dave, Liz and Noah showed up, followed by Dan a little later.
We decided to do another 15 miles to May Creek campground instead of staying in Wisdom but first we ate pizza at the bar across the street.
Dan was tired and remained in Wisdom.

From Wisdom we rode directly west into the flank of the valley and at the foot of the mountains we entered a dense pine forest.
At the campsite the first priority was to take a swim in the cold creek to cool down after a hot day.
Surprisingly I was the first one in the freezing water.
Mike had the most difficulty entering the water but in the end all five of us (Mike,Liz,Dave,Noah and I) were in the water.
In the evening we set up camp and made a fire with dead wood we gathered from the forest floor.
