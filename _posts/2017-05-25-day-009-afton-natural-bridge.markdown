When I woke up and looked outside around 6 AM I saw that the rain had stopped and the fog had disappeared.
I ate breakfast in my room and then hurried to get going as I saw low hangning clouds creeping in.
Luckily the blue ridge parkway was not far away which has very low traffic.
In the morning the clouds stuck to the hills and at the viewpoints there was nothing to see but a vast whiteness.
A blue patch appeared in the sky and shortly thereafter the sunrays were hitting my back.
I had been granted at least a few nice views from the ridge!
The clouds returned intermittently, sprinkling and limiting visibility.

As the route turned away from the ridge and dove below the clouds towards vesuvius it suddenly started raining heavily.
My disk brakes were performing outstandingly, despite the rainy, steep and fast descent I felt confident and everything felt under control.
At the foot of the hill I turned right to Gertie's country store.
I askes if she had anything without meat a she made scrambled eggs, toast and sweet potatoes.
When I came back outside the sky was blue and the sun was shining bright.
The road now followed a river and a railroad track down the valley, surrounded by forested hills.

In Lexington I saw a lot of fancy dressed people on the streets and learned later that it was graduation day.
I bought a powerplug-USB charger as I forgot my powerplug adapter in the motel room.
South of Lexington I crossed a cyclist who told me that there were two cyclists about 6 miles in front of me.
He gave me some directions and asked for my map to show it on.
I said I used my smartphone for navigation. That did not compute.
I was told I have to buy maps and also a little rear-view mirror that goes onto your helmet.
When I said I was heading for the nearest campsite "natural bridge KOA" he replied that I did not want to go there and should keep cycling as long as there is daylight and no rain. "At least to Buchanan!".
He told that he had done the TransAm forty years ago.
After saying goodbye I decided that I actually did want to go to the closest campsite and did not want to keep on cycling as long as there is daylight and no rain.

At the campsite I bought an snickers icecream and also decided that I'm not a big fan of rootbeer.
