I emerged from my tent and was greeted by an intensely colored yellow-orange sky.
I packed up and had breakfast in front of the little convenience store where I bought cereal to complement my breakfast menu with.
I set off under the clouded sky after reinflating my front tire which had ran flat during the night.
The environment turned more alpine again as I climbed towards Williams.
Mu front tire ran flat again and after another attempt to reinflate it and continue it quickly lost all pressure and I had to replace it with my last spare tube.
I discovered that the glue from my patch kit had burst and all glue had dried out.
If I run another flat before Kingsman, 200 km away, where the next bicycle shop is, I'll be in trouble.

At Williams I had second breakfast in front of the safeway and turned onto route 66, which is immediately noticable by the many signs and references at all the bars and restaurants.
I followed interstate 40 east towards Ash Fork.
Luckily there was a wide shoulder so riding the interstate wasn't too bad.
Past Ashfork I turned on route 66 again and had a rough time battling the hills in the killer headwind.
Exhausted and hungry I arrived in Seligman just before 2 PM and went to Westside Lilo's Cafe that explicitely welcomes Germans.
After a delicious veggie sandwich with mushrooms I ordered the carrot cake and I was served an absolutely humongous, delicious carrot cake brick.
I looked at the map and decided to push another 40 km to Grand Canyon Caverns in the ridiculous headwind.
I was not nearly having a bad time as before though.
Perhabs because I had now a full belly and I made the active choice to pedal into the strong wind.
Slowly but steadily I progressed on the quiet road and as I got close to the destination the wind settled down somewhat.

Around 17:40 I arrived at the Grand Canyon Caverns campgrounds and after a nice hot shower and pitching my tent I went to the restaurant.
I did not feel really hungry, courtesy of the carrot cake brick, but ordered a veggie burger anyway because I would be very hungry later if I didn't.
They had mayonaise to go with the fries which is not common at all in the US (ketchup is the default) and I covered my fries with it.
