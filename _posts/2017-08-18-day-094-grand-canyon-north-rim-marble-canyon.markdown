About half an hour after my alarm went off I finally crawled out of my tent and saw the early morning sun hitting the tops of the buttes in the canyon.
As the sun rose, lighting up more of the canyon I had breakfast on the bench at my camping spot.
When I was back on the road I backtracked back to Jakob lake. It was a nice and cool morning and I had a swift ride through the alpine landscape.
On the way I saw a large herd of buffalos.
I arrived at Jakob lake around 11 AM. The next services are another 50 km away so I had lunch there.
As dessert I had the thick raspberry shake again and two cookies.

From Jakob lake I rode east towards Marble Canyon and after a long and fast descent I had an amazing views over the Vermillion Cliffs.
The heat increased spectacularly as I descended and the trees disappeared.
In the afternoon I had a hot and dry ride through the desert along the amazing red cliffs.
I took a short break in Cliff Dwellers and a brief ride later I arrived in the Marble Canyon park.
I rode past funky rock formations to the ice cold Colorado river and had a quick splash.

At the campgrounds I picked a spot with some shade and relaxed, waiting out the terrible heat.
When it cooled off a bit I had dinner (leftover bread with some disgusting cheese slices I bought a the gas station).
A range passed by later and I asked about services on the way to Cameron.
She confirmed what my map showed: only one gas station at about 70 km south of Marble Canyon.
After that the woman of an incredibly sarcastic english couple from the site next to me offered me a piece of watermelon.
As the darkness set in it didn't cool off much (~ 30 degrees Celcius) and it promised to be a hot night.
