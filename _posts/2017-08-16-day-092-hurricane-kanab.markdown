It seemed that I had pitched my tent not totally out of reach of the sprinklers as a small corner of my tent was regularly irrigated throughout the night.
The noise woke me up every time so I did not have a good night's sleep.
When I made my way to the reception to pay a suspicious host yelled at me asking if I had slept on the campgrounds.
When I told them I had pitched my tent in the area designated as tent camping on their map the woman gave me a mocking look and asked how wet I got.
She said that they don't do camping there any more and looked at me like I was to blame.
They charged me a whopping 39 dollars.
I guess I've entered overpriced tourist country.

I backtracked to La Verkin and started climbing towards Zion.
The road was not very nice with a small shoulder and heavy traffic.
That changed when I approached Springdale when a cycling path suddenly appeared.
After a snak at the Shell gas station I entered Zion national park.
The sun was shining bright and it was getting hot, luckily the enormous and steep mountains provided shadow in the canyon.
On the road in the canyon only the park shuttles and bicycles are allowed so I had a very nice and quiet ride up the Zion canyon.
I cycled all the way up to the end point and hiked the start of the "narrows" trail up to the point where you have to start walking in the river.
After a swift ride back down I climbed the many sharp switchbacks to the entrance of the Mt. Carmel tunnel.
Cyclists are not allowed to ride through it and the rangers helped me to hitch a ride through it, which took quite a while.
I eventually got one and was dropped of at the other side of the tunnel.
The landscape here was very strange, the rocks seemded like there were poured and then suddenly solidified.
It seemed I was cycling on another planet.
It was now very hot and I was very glad to arrive at a touristy bar/shop where I ordered a veggie pizza and a lemonade.

After a long lunch break I refilled my water bottles and set course towards Kanab.
Because this region is very touristic I called ahead to an RV park in Kanab.
The woman answering the pphone made a reservation and asked for my credit card number and expiration date.
She then proceeded to ask for the CCV code on the back as well.
Of course I refused and told her she is not supposed to ask for that.
She replied that she did not want to argue and after confirming if I was really really coming she made the reservation without all my credit card details.
When I arrived there I was a bit suspicious due to the credit card thing but she and her husband were very welcoming and hospitable.
The location was excellent as well, with a subway right across the street and a grocery store nextdoor.
Of course I had dinner in the subway.
In the evening I felt pretty tired and quickly crashed in my tent and watch a couple of youtube videos before going to sleep.
