Restday!
I made french toast for breakfast and discovered someone had eaten all of my spaghetti left over from yesterday.
In the morning I could use a computer available to guests to plan my route.
I decided to go off the TransAmerica trail and go north towards Glacier national park, same as Dave and Mike, and then take up the "Norther Tier" and follow it west to Seattle, with a detour to see Mt. Rainier and Snoqualmie (film location of Twin Peaks).
I went back to the grocery store and made grilled cheese sandwiches with salad, tomate and avocados.

Kirk and Tami's replacement Schlump drive had arrived and Kirk and I took a test ride on the tandem.
It is a really cool vehicle, it goes much faster and handles much nimbler than I anticipated.
During the day I played some more piano and in the afternoon Kirk invited me to go with them to a bicycle store and a famous icecream place in town.
They treated me to a delicious huckleberry icecream.

In the evening I met up with Noah, Dan, Liz, Dave and Mike to have a goodbye drink as we would be going different directions the next day.
Dan and Noah were continuing on the TransAm trail, Liz stayed in Missoula with a friend that lives there and the rest of us were going north.

When I got back to the warmshowers house I made some more grilled cheese sandwiches and had a nice talk with Bruce.
I learned that he lived in France for 8 years, making his money from playing the saxophone in the streets of Marseille and other cities.
He showed me a jazz piano book and recommended it to me.
I did a couple of the introductory exercises later that night.
