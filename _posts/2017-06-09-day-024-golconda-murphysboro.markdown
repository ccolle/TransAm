Breakfast consisted of peanutbutter and hazelnutter sandwiches.
I answered a text that Jake sent me yesterday evening to let me know he was back on the TransAm again, about a day and a half ahead of me.
When I left the campgrounds I forgot my helmet.
Luckily I quickly noticed something was off and returned before I really had left.
I planned lunch at Goreville where, you guessed it, a subway is located.
This time the service was very friendly and my veggie-delight crispier than ever.

In the afternoon I rode on small rural roads through the forests of Giant state park.
I passed a lemonade stand and 3 kids sold me a cup for 50 cents.
They were very happy with the two coins (quarters) I payed them and proudly showed them to their mother when she came out of the house.
Further, the route took me along a couple of nice lakes.

Before riding into Murphysboro I made a detour to the Walmart to get a new prepaid straighttalk card as the current one is expiring in a couple of days.
I passed the freezer section and could not resist the Ben and Jerries' unbaked brownie dough core icecream.
I slammed the whole pint of icecream (~0.5l), good for 160% of the daily recommend intake of saturated fat, without a problem.

Next I cycled to Tebithia, my warmshowers host who I contacted yesterday.
She has six kids, all running around and shouting enthousiastically when I came in.
Quite a lively household.
She offered me a small appartment they own, a couple of blocks away, to stay in for the night.
Once I had unpacked in the appartment I called a local pizza place and order a "the veggie".
Worried to leave the appartment unlocked (I did not have a key) I hurriedly went there to pick it up.
Nothing seemed to be missing when I returned.
I ate my pizza in the evening sun on the porch of my private appartment.
