I slept unusually well for camping outside and had maybe woken up once.
I had a little headache and was definitely glad I did not get in the water yesterday.
Mike, Liz and Dave were planning for a shorter day, about 90 km to Grant Village in Yellowstone.
I felt like I could use an easier day and decided to join them.

On the way out of the Grand Teton national park I stopped multiple times to look back at the awesome mountains and take more pictures.
We had a long brake at Signal Mountain Lodge again and had later a relaxed lunch at a gas station at Flagg ranch.
We were definitely taking it easy.
Not long thereafter we entered Yellowstone.
There was a huge traffic jam at the entry point.
Again Dave got the four of us in with his pass.
The ride into south Yellowstone was beautiful.
We climbed along the Lewis Canyon, with the wild rushing Lewis river at the bottom.
The traffic on the other hand was terrible.
The road had a no or a very narrow shoulder and cars and big RV's were passing us continuously, often way to close for comfort.
Some of them were even agressive and roared passed us full throttle and on one occasion the passengers in a car gave us the middle finger when they passed us.

I arrived first, around 5 PM, at Grant Village, went to the grocery store to buy dinner and proceeded to the campgrounds.
It is an enormous campsite and when I arrived I got into the long line at the reception.
When I was almost at the front of the line Mike,Dave and Liz arrived and we registered together.

A horde of Indian people arrived later that night in several cars and installed themselves in a couple of sites next to us.
We were appalled by their total disregard of the bear safety regulations.

The showers were in a building, seperate from the campgrounds, and cost 4.25$ but when I got there I was told cyclists could shower for free!
I used Liz's multiburner to cook a knorr fetuccini with white sauce instant meal.
It was surprisingly good.
