I woke up around 6 with a slight headache.
Everyone was still asleep (it was a Sunday...) so I quietly packed up.
When I was almost ready to go Tony showed up and offered me cereal for breakfast.
We talked about the road ahead and after that I set off while Tony waved me goodbye.
On the way out of Folsom I passed a safeway and stopped to buy second breakfast.
In the store I was offered 12 donuts for only 2.50$ (they had made to many for an order).
Off course I couldn't resist such a bargain.
After some hills I started the long climb towards 2000 meters which would take the whole day.

On the way into Plymouth I cycled through a stop sign without coming to a complete stop and a driver behind me yelled angrily something about abiding the law.
After a short break there I was back on the road and continued climbing.
It was getting hot but bearable and by times there was a nice cooling breeze.
Around midday I took another break along Shake Ridge road at a small convenience store and the friendly lady there called to the Cooks station restaurant up the mountain to make sure I would be able to have a late lunch there.
Around 14:30 I arrived there and had a veggie burger.
One of the staff members told me they allow cyclists to camp for free at their restaurant but I wanted to put in some more miles so I didn't take the offer.

A slow 20 km later I arrived at Bear river lake, bought some food in the resort campsite and cycled to the other side of the lake to set up at a USFS campground.
Later in the evening the campground attendant startled me by suddenly talking loudly to me from behind.
He said there was a bear roaming the campground at night and advised me not to leave outside but hang it in a tree or take it with me in my tent.
The last tip is a bit strange because I'm pretty sure that is exactly what you're not supposed to do.
I tied my tent's stormlines together and after a few attempts my food was hanging high up in a tree.
