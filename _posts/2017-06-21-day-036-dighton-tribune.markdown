We woke up around 6 and while I was eating breakfast Noah and Amanda went to the gasstation for breakfast and coffee.
When I left town I was met by a hard cross/head wind from the southwest again and I was barely doing 16 km/h.
The sun quickly broke through and the tempereatures rose well into the thirties.
After passing Scott city I arrived around 1 PM in Leoti.
I ate a (surprisingly good) vegetarian burrito in a gasstation and saw Noah arriving while I called ahead to a bicycle shop in Pueblo CO, to order new bicycle tires.

The temperatures climed over 40 degrees Celcius and Noah proposed to wait out the heat in the local pool.
He texted Amanda about our plan and about an hour later all three of us were cooling off at the pool.

When dark clouds covered the sun we decided to get going together.
It was a bit risky but it paid off because the whole stretch to Tribune we rode on the border between rainstorms and sunshine and were spared of the rain and the sun.
We crossed into a new time zone, Mountain time!

When we arrived at Tribune we went to the only restaurant in town and I had deep fried onion rings with deep fried cheese sticks as there were no other options for vegetarians.
After that it was off to the city park and have a shower in the public pool.
Next we set up under a pavilion.
