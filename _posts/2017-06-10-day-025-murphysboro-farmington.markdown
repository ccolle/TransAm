During the first part of the day I rode through the vast corn and wheat fields of southern Illinois.
60 km in, around 11 AM, I rode into Chester.
It was a bit early for lunch but decided to have it anyway because, that's right, there is a subway.
I realize that this journal is slowly turning into a cross-country subway review collection but let me just say that the staff was not friendly at all.
They even didn't offer to toast my bread.
Outrageous!

Just oustide of Chester I cycled over the Mississippi river into Missouri!
In the big, flat and wide valley of the Mississippi a strong headwind made progress difficult.
I was riding in my lower gears on the flats!
I was (almost) glad to reach the hills on the other side, signalling the start of the Ozarks.
The hills offered some protection from the fierce headwind but I now had to battle my way up them.

I arrived in Farmington around 16:30 at an awesome hostel called "Al's place".
There were already 4 cyclists present, 3 westbounders like me and 1 eastbounder.
One of them, a texan, I passed several days ago when riding out of Hodgeville KY towards Mammoth Cave.

I ordered Chinese (pick up) and went to the Walmart to buy breakfast for the next day.
In the evening we watched "the campaign" and "cast away" together.
