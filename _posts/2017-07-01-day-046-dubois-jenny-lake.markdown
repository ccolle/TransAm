Dave, Liz and Mike left at 6:15.
I slept until 7 and went back to the "cowboy cafe" and had French toast and a delicious quinoa/rice dish.
Around 8 I was on the road.
The first 50 km of the day would be all climbing towards the togwotee pass, around 3000m high.
A couple of kilometers out of Dubois I felt stings and itches all over my arms and legs.
When I stopped to check that I noticed I was surrounded by hundreds of mosquitos.
It was insane, I have never seen so many mosquitos at once.
If I would swipe one arm, there would be already a good 20 of them on the other.
I frantically started looking for my mosquito repellant, wildly flapping my arms around and throwing everything that was not my mosquito repellant on the road as I was searching for it.
When I finally had it I quickly put some on in tiny squirts and then raced onwards in an attempt to escape them.

At the first convenience store I bought the strongest mosquito repellant they had.
It was a big spray-canister, much better suited to deal with these amounts of mosquitos than my little squirt bottle.
I showered myself with it and then proceeded to climb towards the pass.
Every turn offered an amazing view on the surrounding mountains, decorated with dense pine forest and snow.

When I arrived at the pass I saw Dave, Liz and Mike resting at the side of the road.
Together we descended towards the Grand Teton national park.
The Grand Teton mountain range quickly entered our view.
They are truly epic and almost don't look real.
When we got at the park entrance Dave got us all in for free with his annual pass.

It was a Saturday and a lot of tourists were in the park which meant heavy traffic on the roads.
We had a quick stop at Signal Mountain Lodge for an icecream and not much later we arrived at the Jenny lake campgrounds.
There are spots reserved for hikers/bikers.

Dave and Mike went for a swim. I didn't join them as I wasn't feeling a 100% and I know myself well enough that it is very risky for me to get into the cold water at such a time if I don't want to get sick.
Mike bought firewood at the visitor centre and at night we had dinner together and made a campfire.
