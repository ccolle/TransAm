In the morning I made more sweet delicious french toast.
Dave left before me. I met him and Mike later at the ACA HQ at 7 AM.
Mike had arranged a warmshower host, Alan, in Big Arm, on the border of Flathead lake for that night.

A little later I discovered a failing link in my chain and I had to take it out and make my chain 2 links shorter.
I caught up with Dave and Mike at a gasstation and from thereon we started the last climb before entering the valley of Flathead lake.
The descent into it offered a beautiful view on the large mountains.
We had still some way to go to get to the lake.
We followed the US 93 north from St. Ignatius.
It was a busy road with a very narrow shoulder.
When my stomach started growling I checked google maps and to my great delight I discovered a subway in Ronan, only a couple of miles away, where I had a veggie delight.

When I rolled out of the subway Dave and Mike passed by and together we rode to the Walmart in Polson.
Just before arriving there we turned a corner and were presented with a scenic view over the huge lake.
Dave and Mike bought lunch in the Walmart and I went for a pint of sweet old B&J's.
After lunch a car pulled up and asked for Michael.
It was Alan the warmshowers host.
He offered to take our bags so we could ride unloaded to his house.

At Alan's we were fed fresh ice water and hand picked berries.
We went down to Flathead lake and hade a nice refreshing swim.
When we returned we were served a delicious stew and later cherry cobbler with icecream.
In the evening we watches wimbledon and a part of the tour de france.
