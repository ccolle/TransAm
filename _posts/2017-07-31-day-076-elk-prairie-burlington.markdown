When I rode out of the campgrounds the Elk Prairie was covered with mist.
I cycled down the foggy valley towards the ocean.
I couldn't enjoy the views due to the fog but the atmosphere was kind of nice, riding on the border of the ocean, with the sound of the waves muffled by the white haze.
In Trinidad I stopped for a hot chocolate milk and by that time the fog had completely disappeared.
I had a very nice ride towards McKinleyville on quiet roads over the cliffs.

When I approached Arcata I snapped spoke #10 and I was riding with 2 broken spokes again.
Luckily there are 3 bicycle shops in Eureka, only 15 km away.
One of them was the obvious choice at it had a subway across the street and I was arriving there around lunch time.
I went to that bike shop and while the mechanic was working on my bike I went to the subway for lunch.
The person in front of me ordered "veggie patties" on her sandwich and of course I went for it as well.
It was very tasty.

When I got back to the bike shop my bicycle was ready to go and I continued towards Ferndale through rural country.
After Ferndale I climbed the valley of the Eel river and re-entered the ever so impressive redwoods.
In the evening sun I had a magical ride on the Avenue of the Giants towards Burlington State park.
I arrived quite late again and after a shower and dinner I turned in for the night.
