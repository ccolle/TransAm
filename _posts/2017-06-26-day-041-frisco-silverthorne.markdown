I slept until 7:30 which almost felt like sleeping in.
The racers had already left of course.
Jake went to a coffee shop while I tried replacing my disk brake pads.
I had a little trouble as the pistons would not reset and it was impossible to fit the new (thicker) brake pads.
I put the old ones back in and cycled to a bike shop in Frisco.
Luckily there are many around here, in this rather touristic area.
For 15$ the mechanic fitted both front and rear brake pads and after that I went to the local library to update my journal.

Jake met me later at the library and told me he had found a warmshowers host, Bruse, about 30 km further down the TransAm route.
We went to meet Bruce at the closeby school of Frisco where he works.
He gave us directions on how to find his place and next I went to the Walmart for groceries and icecream.
Outside I ate the customary pint of Ben and Jerry's.

When I made my way down to Bruce's house I passed many Tour Divide racers along the way.
After cycling over a couple kilometers of gravel road I arrived at the remote and quiet house of Bruce.
I pitched my tent and took a shower and by the time I was done Bruce had come home from work.

He was going to help his "neighbour" (a few kilometers away), Dale.
Dale is an artist and Bruce asked if I'd be interested to join him and have a look at Dale's work.
When we arrived at Dale's place Jake was just cycling up the gravel road and he joined us.
Together we took a look at Dale's artwork and workshop.
After that we watched Bruce and Dale do some decorative work on his house.

Jake cycled off to Bruce's house and a few minutes later Bruce asked if I wanted to ga back as well and offered his car, after making sure I could drive a stick-shift.
The ride on the gravel roads back to Bruce's place was a lot of fun.

Jake and I relaxed until Bruce returned, driven by Dale. Dale offered us a tour of his house and fresh vegetables from his garden so we went back down there.
Dale has a very cool house.
There is a three floor high showroom full of hist artpieces and a indoor river at the bottom.
After the tour he harvested some veggies from his garden and when we were back at Bruce's we cooked dinner together.
