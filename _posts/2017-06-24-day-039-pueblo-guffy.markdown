I got up around 6 and Michael was already busy moving a lot of stuff outside as he was doing a yard sale that day.
I said goodbye and went to a nearby supermarket for breakfast.
On the way there I passed uncountably many fancy old cars who were going to a show-car convention in town.
In front of the supermarket I had breakfast and a bagel, donut and cinnamon roll later I was back on the road.

Outside of Pueblo the first hills appeared and before long I could see snow topped mountains signalling the start of the Rocky Mountains.
It is stunning how much the landscape had changed from the endless flats of Kansas and eastern Colorado in only two days.
Just passed Wetmore I crossed David from Virginia riding east.

I refueled at a gasstation in Florence and had lunch in a subway in ca√±on city.
There were Chinese people in front of me in the line who were so rude to the staff that it became hilarious.

I started climbing towards royal gorge and before I knew it I was surrounded by mountains.
After a big climb (helped by a nice soft tailwind) I arrived in Guffy and was greeted by Bill, the owner of the cabin that cyclist can stay in.
He was part of the original bikecentennial of '76 and has a very interesting garage/workshop.
A few moments later Jake walked up, seems like I had caught up again.
Later we went to a local restaurant together and I was very excited to see a veggie-burger on the menu.
It was delicious.
We finished with a sundae/brownie combo for dessert.
