I got up early and slowly prepaired for the coming day.
Yesterday I arrived after office hours (the park is owned by the state) so I had to wait untill 8 am, when the reception opens, to pay for my stay.
On my way to the bathroom a man came up to me and warned me about a copperhead snake in the gentlemen's bathroom.
I decided that it was not that urgent and did a 180.

Breakfast consisted of possibly the baddest oatmeal I have ever had.
"Maple syrup and brown sugar"-flavoured oatmeal is VERY sweet and salty.
When I passed a food lion a little over an hour of cycling later, my stomach was growling again and I decided to go in for a second breakfast.
While I was enjoying my brie-tomato sandwich outside of the food lion a friendly stranger came up to me and inquired about my destination.
After learning about my plans he, Brian, insisted that I should be very careful.
Brian gave me his phone number and said to call him if I'm in any kind of trouble.
After saying goodbye to Brian, telling me another couple of times to be very careful, I drove on through vast wheatfields lined with blue flowers.


The heat was quickly increasing to near-unbearable levels.
Luckily I planned a short-distance day.
When I arrived at the Bell Isle state park, it appeared that the camping site was fully booked.
Stephen and Peggy, the couple working at the reception, and another couple who were checking out (I forgot their names) were very helpful in trying to find a solution.
The checking-out-couple proposed to drive me partway to the next campsite as it was a considerable distance away.
After calling said campsite to check if they weren't fully booked as well we got the response that tents were not allowed.
Stephen then made the very generous offer to let me stay at their spot.
Very relieved I accepted and set up my tent next to their RV.

Not long thereafter, Anita, who overheard my troubles at the reception invited me to join her for dinner together with the 4 other members of "loners on wheels", an organisation for single campers.
At 5 p.m. we drove to the nearby "oak restaurant", with good food and oversized desserts.
One of the ladies told the waiter that she would take care of my bill, and persisted after a weak attempt by me to decline.
It was very nice meeting and dining with the 5 ladies from "loners on wheels".

Later that evening, back at the campsite Brian and Peggy invited me for a drink in their RV which ,once you set foot in it, feels like a full-fledged house.
We had a pleasant talk, even briefly going into politics #trump.
