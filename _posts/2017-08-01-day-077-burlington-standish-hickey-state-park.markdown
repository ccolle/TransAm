I had an amazing morning ride through the redwoods.
The temperature quickly rose as I climbed the Eel river valley further.
Out of Garberville I rode past a huge traffic jam that went on for miles (in my direction).
When I arrived at the source it appeared that road workers were hanging new huge metal nets to prevent falling rocks.
It was impressive to watch.
While I was waiting one of them gave me cold water bottle.

Just outside of Legett I pulled over for lunch.
The lady of "the peg house" told me about the nice campgrounds across the street which has hiker/biker spots.
With the temperature rising above 40 degree Celcius I decided to call it a day.
Especially since a big climb was coming up.
I set up my tent and returned to the restaurant to make use of the wifi there.
I relaxed there the whole afternoon and had dinner as well.

In the evening it was still very hot and I decided to go for a refreshing swim in the local swimming hole in the river.
