Scott and I left around the same time. The morning offered a very soft descent down the valley.
After 20 km we stopped at a gas station, coffee for Scott and hotdogbuns with peanutbutter for me.
The heat started rising and of course there were more hills to climb.
The number of dog-chase incidents remained limited to two.

Tired out, out of water and hungry I stopped at Buckhorn, signed the cyclist log book of the shopkeeper and ate my leftover bread with peanutbutter.
As I was about to hit the road again Scott arrived, in dire need of a drink.
Booneville was not far and less than two hours later I arrived at a Presbyterian church which welcomes cyclists, and allows them to camp.

Not long thereafyer Scott arrived as well.
When we finished unpacking and setting up our tents under the pavilion we went do a nearby fast-food restaurant together.
After ordering a man came up to us and said our meals had been paid for, as an act of God's kindness.
We talked for a while (mainly he and Scott) and I had my first curly fries and onion rings.

When the sun had set there were many fireflies blinking in the dusk.
