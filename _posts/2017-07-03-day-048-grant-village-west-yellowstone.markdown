We had agreed to set the alarm for 5 and try to be on the road by 6.
Alas, we had a slower than planned start.
I only got out of my sleeping bag at 5:20 and was the second one out of his tent.
I was a very cold morning.
We ate breakfast and were on the road by 6:40.

We rode through dense pine forests as the the sun rose over the tree tops.
I stopped at a cool lookout over some waterfalls deep below and was told a grizzly with two cubs had been spotted nearby.
As I cycled further I looked around with my camera (and bearspray) ready but did not get to see them.

Suddenly a large white cloud appeared over the tree tops.
Old Faithful had just erupted.
When we arrived at the geyser we had over an hour before it was predicted to erupt again.
Dave, Mike and I visited the other geysers nearby while Liz hung back.

The three of us were back in time to see Old Faithful in action, only 2 minutes off schedule.
After that we visited the spectacular Old Faithful lodge and lots of geysers and hot springs along the route.
The traffic was ridiculous and huge traffic jams appeared at every turnout.
With our bikes we could easily skip them and visit the very touristic Yellowstone "attractions".

On the way out of the park we saw a solitary bison.
At a turnout overlooking some waterfalls I snapped a spoke in my rear wheel again.
There is a bicycle shop in West Yellowstone and I said to the others I would rush ahead to make sure they could fix it before closing time (the next day was the 4th of July as well).

With loads of time to spare I arrived in the bicycle shop the guy put my bike in the stand and told me to get a correct sized spoke from another bicycle store around the corner.
While he was fixing me bike I ordered a mango smoothie and a giant blueberry muffin (there is a bar in the bicycle shop).
I texted Mike where I was and about an hour after I arrived they showed up at the bicycle shop as well, just as the repairs were done.

We went to a pizza restaurant in town and did groceries.
All the campgrounds in town were full, probably because the 4th of July was the next day.
We cycled a couple of miles north to Baker's Hole campground.
It was full as well but thanks to Liz' diplomacy the campgrounds' host told us that a biker (motorcycle) was willing to share his spot with anyone that showed up.
We went to meet them and quickly set up our tents as thunderstorms were rolling in.
Not much later the lightnings were striking closeby and hail fell from the sky.\
