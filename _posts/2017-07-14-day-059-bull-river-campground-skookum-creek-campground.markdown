In the morning I packed the slowest and Dave and Mike rolled out before me.
The first hour we were riding through roadworks which was nice as traffic was low and slow and the roads new and fresh.
Along Clark Fork river I cycled into Idaho and a new time zone.
I passed enormous stone quarries mining a large vertical cliff right next to the road.
In Clark Fork I had a quick stop at a gasstation and then cycled to Sandpoint around the huge lake Pend Oreille.
I arrived in Sandpoint around 10:30 and went to Cedar street bridge public market and had a "hulk" smoothie (3 fruits, spinach and protein powder) and a delicious garden wrap.
Mike cycle into town around 12 (he and Dave got lost for a while and Dave blew his tire again).
They were going to stay in Sandpoint but I decided to push on towards Newport.

It was another hot and sunny afternoon.
I left Idaho and entered Washington State as I rode into Newport.
I went to the library but had to leave almost immediately because it was closing due to the exceptional heat (38 Celcius).
The campsite I had planned going to was full so I was forced to continue north, along the Pend Oreille river to the next one, Skookum Creek campground.

It is a very primitive but free campground although I'm not sure if it is only for members of "DNR", whatever that means...
The evening was still very hot and the forecasts looked dry so I pitched my tent without rainfly.
