Around 4:40 loud thunder and flashing lighting woke me up.
It was already getting light so I decided to pack up before the rain hit.
When I just finished packing it starting drizzling and I quickly ate a couple of hazelnut spread sandwiches.
It seemed that I was on the outskirts of the thunderstorm and it only rained lightly.
The early morning sun, combined with the menacing dark thunderclouds made a very beatiful sky.
The road was very quiet, on the 60 km stretch to Ione there were only a handful of cars that passing me.
Outside of the grocery store in Ione I met another westbounder who started in Boston two months ago.

After second breakfast it was time for the climb of the day, a relatively short but steep one out of the Pend Oreille river valley.
Through Colville National forest I made my way to the cyclist-only Bacon hostel.
Due to my very early start I already arrived there by 11:40 and had the whole afternoon to relax and do laundry.
Luckily the hostel is equipped with an AC, which I quickly turned on as the temperature outside were rising towards 37 Celcius.

After a long day of cycling Mike and Dave showed up in the late afternoon.
In the evening the hosts, Barry and Shelly Bacon, passed by to say hello and welcome us in their fantastic hostel.
Later I cleaned my bicycle while Dave and Mike played a game of airhockey.
