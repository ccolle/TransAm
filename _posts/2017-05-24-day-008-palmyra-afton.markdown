In the morning Elizabeth prepared crisped bagels with cream cheese.
When I looked outside I saw a hummingbird on the washline and woodpeckers, a bluejay and other birds visiting the bird feeder untill the squirrels decided to seize it.
I said goodbye and continued with replenished bagel-energy.
The sky was grey but the rain stayed out during the morning.
When passing through Charlottesville I went to a bicycle store to get chamois-cream for my behind suffering from the long days in the saddle.

It started raining when I rode out of Charlottesville and it would not stop for the remainder of the day.
As I climbed the hill towards Afton a heavy mist rolled in.
When the visibility became very poor I found myself on a busy road.
Not an ideal situation... It was too dangerous to continue cycling.
I waited for an hour but the conditions did not seem to improve, if anything they had becone worse.
I then tried walking and pushing my bike behind the guard rail.
It required frequent fights with bushes and progress was painstakingly slow.
I changed the strategy to walking on the narrow shoulder and hopping over the guard rail as soon I saw headlights shining through the fog.
I progressed significantly faster and easier than the previous method.
About half an hour and dozens of guard rail hops later I arrived at the "Inn at Afton" motel.
It was full but the receptionist pointed me to a closeby motel which had still available rooms.
A scary 10 minutes later I arrived safely at "colony house" motel and checked in.

When no one was looking I quickly took my bicycle inside the room with me.
The motel room was spacious with a double bed, TV and a microwave.
For the rest of the day I updated my blog and watched the television as rain kept pouring down outside.
