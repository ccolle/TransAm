Alan prepared his famous blueberry pancakes for breakfast.
The blueberries were supplied by a friend of his who had handpicked them in Texas.
After the delicious breakfast we said goodbye and had a scenic morning drive along the lake.

At the northern end of the lake we got on the "Great Northern Historical Trail", a paved cyclist path, and followed it to the end in Kalispell.
I scoped a subway in Columbia falls and had lunch there and met back up with Mike and Dave.
Together we made our way to Glacier national park in the afternoon.
Once more Dave got us for free with his anual pass.
In the park we had to wait an hour before we could cycle to the Sprague Creek campground as the road is closed to cyclists between 11 AM and 4 PM.

At the campsite priority #1 cooling off in the large clear lake McDonald, surrounded by majestic mountains covered with thick pine forests.
We set up camp at the spot reserved for bikers/hikers.
