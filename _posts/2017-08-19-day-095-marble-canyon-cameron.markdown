I woke up before sunrise and was on the road as the sun started peeking over the steep red cliffs.
After a quick breakfast at the gas station of Marble Canyon I set off to Cameron.
I crossed over the Colorado river that runs through the Grand Canyon downstream.
It was already quite hot in the morning but luckily there was a breeze.
As I approached the Gap a large white van matched my speed, a window rolled down and I got a big applause from the passengers.
We had a quick conversation and the driver declared me a hero.
As the pulled away everybody waved and gave me the thumbs up.

After a long morning of climbing I had a burrito and icecream at The Gap.
Next I continued to Cameron, mostly downhill.
I passed many stands on the roadside selling Navajo craftwork.
As the temperature was running into the fourties I arrived at Cameron and took shelter in the Chevron gas station where I had a nice sandwich.
My map showed a compground close to the conoco gas station nextdoor.
After some asking around I discovered the small patch of grass behind the laundromat and checked in at the conoco gas station.
I was charged 10$, much better than the 35$ RV park down the road.
Laundry was due so I made use of the laundromat there.
Next I went back to the Chevron gas station to make use of the wifi.
I checked out the Burger King and discovered they offered a veggie burger.
I relaxed at the Burger King for a couple of hours, making use of their very good wifi.

When I looked out the window I realized the sun had set and night was setting in.
I returned to my camp spot behind the laundromat and a native american came by and aske for money.
He seemed quite persistent so I gave him a small amount in the hope we would leave.
It was very hot at night and strong winds were constantly blowing so I removed the rain fly to increase ventilation and decrease fly-flapping.
