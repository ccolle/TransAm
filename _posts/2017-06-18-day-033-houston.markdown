After a good night's sleep I woke up around 7 AM.
Jake had already left for an early start.
My plan if the day was resting and updating my journal, I was running several days behind.

Janet invited me to join her to go to the church but I declined.
I did join her and Orvin, her husband, for lunch in the pizza hut together with members of their church group.
They were very friendly and it was nice meeting them.

After the pizza hut I took a nap and was awoken by the bicycle shop calling me to say that I could come pick up my bicycle.
Before sunset Janet and Orvin gave me a tour of the city, showing me interesting places in Newton.
It seems like a nice town.
When we returned we had dinner (more mulberry pie!) and talked about the history of Mennonites and other things.
