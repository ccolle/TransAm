It has been a while since the last update.
Meanwhile I went of the transamerica trail in Missoula to see Glacier and pick up the northern tier to Seattle.
From there I cycled down the Pacific coast and am currently about 300 km north of San Francisco.
In total I've cycled about 9500 km so far.
I'll update the blog someday but probably not very soon :)

The ride has been amazing up to now.
Some of the highlights include:
- Glacier Nat. park
- Mt. Rainier
- Oregon Coast
- Californias redwoods
